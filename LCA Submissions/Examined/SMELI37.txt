Topic: Mid-Range Nuclear Capability in North Korea



Article: South Korea: North Korea may have mid-range nuclear capability

On Tuesday, a South Korean government official said that it looks like North Korea has succeeded in miniaturizing a warhead enough to be put onto a Nodong missile (a mobile ballistic missile made by North Korea). South Korea thinks that North Koreas ballistic missile has the power to deliver a one ton (907 kg) warhead a distance of 2,000 km (1243 miles), putting U.S. military bases in South Korea and Japan within range. They believe the missile could have mid-range nuclear power. It could be very dangerous to the U.S. bases within its range.  While the government official then said that they have no proof to prove the power, it looks like Kim Jong Un has said that his country has successfully miniaturized a nuclear weapon. Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, has carried out its fourth nuclear test on January 6th and has insisted its nuclear program will continue despite further United Nations sanctions passed against the country last month. South Korea had also been having GPS disruptions that happened because of North Korean interference which ended on Tuesday afternoon. The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning says they traced the jamming to five different areas in North Korea. The ministry says 962 airplanes, 692 ships and 1,785 communication network base stations were affected but no damage was reported. North Korea is still yet to respond to the Souths accusation. 



If the missile is infact as powerful as South Korea believes it to be I believe the U.S. military bases located in South Korea and Japan could be in great danger, thus engaging the U.S. in further conflict with North Korea. This conflict between North and South Korea could relate to our remix of Shakespeare as there is great mistrust between the countries though they are neighbors resulting in conflict.

Topic: China Executions 



Article: China is the world's top executioner, but it doesn't want you to know that

Amnesty International, a non-profit-making organization for human rights, said in its most recent annual report of the death penalty worldwide that there has been an increase of more than 50% of executions worldwide in 2015 than the year before. People think China is the worlds top executioner. A research group from Cornell Law School says that there were at least 2,400 executions in China in 2014, or one execution per 562,500 people.The executions in China continue to be higher than all other countries put together. State media and other coverage of executions has actually gone down in China. While the number of executions has remained high, the number of capital crimes went down by 13% in 2011.  Lots of crimes were de-listed, meaning they werent prosecuted very often. The Chinese government is slowly trying to decrease the use of the death penalty. A number of big botched convictions and executions have also sparked greater disapproval and criticism of the death penalty in China. One case involving the wrongful execution of an Inner Mongolian teenager, 18-year-old Huugjilt convicted of rape and murder in 1996 got lots of attention. Nine years after his execution,  convicted serial rapist and murderer Zhao Zhihong confessed to the crime, sparking a review of the case and intense media coverage. While the government paid the family of Huugjilt in exchange for his wrongful execution, there has been a general shift in attitudes against capital punishment. 



I do not believe in the death penalty. Not necessarily for the sake of humanity, but simply because I believe criminals who are worthy of the death penalty should suffer and do their time in prison. Theres also the rare cases, like that of Huugjilt, where an innocent man is killed wrongfully. We could incorporate this event into our remix of Shakespeare by having a wrongful death of an innocent character.

Topic: Bangladeshi writer murdered



Article: Secular Bangladeshi writer killed in the street

Blogger, Nazimuddin Samad, was murdered by machete-wielding attackers in the  Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, becoming the sixth writer or publisher to be killed in the city in the last 14 months. The attack happened late Wednesday as Samad, a master's student at Jagannath University, was on his way back home from his evening classes. Police believe the attack was planned. He was circled by by a group of three to four people who hacked Samad with machetes, shot him, and ran from the scene on motorcycles. While no arrests have been made, Ansar al-Islam, the Bangladesh division of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent has claimed responsibility for the recent killing. Bangladeshi students took to the streets to protest against the brutal killing. The killing is certain to add to fears among writers who have challenged religious thought in Bangladesh.  



Though Samad didnt deserve to be attacked and killed as brutally as he had been, in his profession these kinds of things arent entirely unheard of. Five writers had already been killed in the city. I think in his profession he shouldve been more careful. We could incorporate this event into our remix of Shakespeare by having a violent death of a innocent man that had been in a dangerous occupation.
