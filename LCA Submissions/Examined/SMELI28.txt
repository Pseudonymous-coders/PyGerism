 Federal Judge Sebastin Casanello ordered the detention of Lzaro Bez, the owner of leading construction firms that are based in the Southern province of Santa Cruz. Argentine prosecutors alleged that Mr. Bez transferred money abroad through a global network of shell companies. Mrs. Kirchners administration said the allegations had political motivations. Mr. Bez has denied the allegations and said that the probe was part of a campaign to harm his firms and discredit the Kirchner administration. He said that he had no investments in any country other than Argentina.



I dont see how this can relate to one of shakespeares plays or I dont know a play to be able to relate this to.

 Brazils Congress moved closer to impeaching President Dilma Rousseff. There was a release of a report recommending lawmakers vote in favor of her trial before the Senate. President Dilma Rousseff is accused of using loans from the state to plug a massive budget hole, although she denies the allegations. There is evidence that is able to impeach the president, but one of the top cabinet members had said that the report doesnt support the proceedings. The report will now be considered by 65 member special committee, which might vote on it on monday.  The impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff have gained momentum in recent weeks. Millions of Brazilians took part in street demonstrations calling for her to leave her position. The the president has been damaged by a massive corruption probe centered on state oil company, Petrobras, that has ensnared several members of her ruling Workers Party.



 President Dilma Rousseff is accused of using illegal actions to possibly try to fix a massive budget hole of sorts. This reminds me of Macbeth. The President had gone as far as to be accused of using illegal actions and had started off seeming good but people are now calling for her ouster. This seems to closely relate to Macbeth, since he had started off noble and a good man, but then he had started to use dishonest actions and people soon feared and were wanting his ouster from his Thane title, just like with President Dilma Rousseff and how she may be impeached.

 I honestly do not see how this could relate to one of shakespeares place because there are either not any plays that relate to this or there are not any plays that I know of currently that could relate to this news article.
