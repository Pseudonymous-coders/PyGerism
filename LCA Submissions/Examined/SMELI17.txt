Human Rights Watch found the remains of a supposedly U.S. supplied bomb in an 

airstrike on a Yemen market that killed 119 people. Even though they tried to reach U.S. officials could not be reached, despite being in Bahrain. Also, the Saudi-led coalition has been fighting  the Shiite rebels for a while.

This article shocked me to think that the U.S. could just bomb a marketplace of anywhere, there couldve been innocent children or innocent people that didnt deserve what happened to them.

Idk how it could connect to a shakespeare play yet

Germany is putting Sven Lau on trial on four counts of helping the terrorist group called Jaish al-Muhajireen Wal-Ansar ot JAMWA. He supposedly was the go-to contact for people wanting to join the group. As well, earlier in 2014 Sven had tried to create a Sharia Police in German territory in a town called Wuppertal.

I think Germany played the right call on Sven, if they hadnt indicted him he would still be out recruiting and if he wasnt recruiting for them then no harm was caused in the end.

Maybe, for Macbeth you could have someone meet up with a go-to contact for the group and have them join then have someone they trust tell them that they could easily reach the top of the group.

The spokeswoman for NATO revealed that the agenda for the meeting contains the Ukraine Crisis and Addition of the Minsk accords which should end all fighting in the area. They also plan to debate about military activities between NATO and Russia where they plan to focus on transparency and reducing risk between them.

I think its good that theyre trying to fix relations and reach conclusions together.

In Romeo and Juliet you could have the families meet and have a fight break out and thats where Tybalt and Mercutio die.
