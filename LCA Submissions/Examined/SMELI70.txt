Summary and stuff-

 Belgium joins 6 other countries in europe who have completely quit using coal as an energy source. Britain and Austria plan to stop using coal by 2025, and Portugal plans to stop using coal by 2020. Since Belgium has stopped using coal their yearly co2 emissions have been cut by 2 million tons. Other countries in like Poland have increased their use of coal recently. America and China have started to reduce the amount of coal they use. 

I think that it is important that countries are aware of their carbon footprint. These gases can have a very negative effect on our atmosphere, so we need to use cleaner energy sources to reduce the amount we put in our atmosphere. I dont see any connection to Shakespeare since this is dealing with energy that countries use and co2 emissions.

Summary and stuff-

88 out of 115 members of a church voted in favor of same-sex marriage in the church. However members of the church do not have to participate in same sex marriage ceremonies. The Evangelical-Lutheran Church is Norways Largest church. This is important because it shows how the church in Norway is dealing with same sex marriage laws.

I think the event is strange. I suppose that this branch of christianity believes in same sex marriage, but it does not make a whole lot sense due to the fact that most of the other denominations dont. I dont see how this connects to anything that Shakespeare wrote.

Summary and stuff- 

Because a shelter for migrants was overcrowded and the conditions overall were not that great he decided to set fire to the place and blame it on the Neo nazis. 1 million refugees entered germany in 2015. Lately there has been a surge of attacks on shelters holding refugees. There has been cases like this one, for example a 17 year old afghan set fire to a different shelter. This is important because there are millions of refugees in Europe now and it is becoming a bigger issue. 

I think that all the refugees in Europe is becoming a problem, and not just because some of the refugees are violent. They are having many negative effects on Europe. However I think that the immigrants cant complain, and the people that dont like the refugees should not result to violence. I thinks this connects to Macbeth when it comes to power. These people are trying to take matters into their own hands and end up screwing themselves over when they go on power trips, and Macbeth screws everything up when he trys to obtain tons of power. I think we might be able to come up with some sort of working adaptation.
