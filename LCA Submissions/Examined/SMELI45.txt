Article: China restricts North Korea trade over nuclear tests

North Korea has always dabbled with different types of nuclear weapons over the past several years. This country has always been known for having the idea of nuclear weapons in their history. Doing this goes against the united nations violations, but the country still continues the scheme.  After they tested the nuclear rockets in january of 2016 and satellite in february, China backed out. China and North Korea have always had a trade line with each other. China shipped mostly coal, gold, jet fuel to North korea, and many other raw materials. Even though China stopped the trade North Korea still shipps supplies to them. When the supplies are shipped to China they are thoroughly checked multiple times to make sure there isn't anything dangerous inside. In January when North korea launched the long distance rocket, China realized that they might be fueling their nuclear program for them. China knows that the trade will lower their amount of currency, but it was worth it to them to not get involved any more than they already have. They stepped out to avoid any fighting or arguing with different countries in the future. After this decision was made the US president (Barack Obama) and the Chinese leader (Xi JinPing) met up and tried to think of a plan to stop North Koreas nuclear plans.



Finally someone is reacting to the past events of North Korea. I think its best we leave the matter in the hands of the US and China representatives. Im Proud that the US is trying to pair up with China to stop North Korea, because there weapon making is getting out of hand and scaring the world with what they're doing. North Korea has been doing this for a while now and finally we decided to do something about it. I hope these two leaders end up stopping the nuclear project before its too late.

Article: Australia: No refugee kids left in detention here; Critics: They're offshore

If you are an immigrant or foreigner to Australia that wants to get away from your old country and start a new life in the outback, you are sent straight to Nauru Island. Australians look for these refugees in the waters because the refugees try to land on Australia's shores through boats. Most are caught because the security is tight around the shores of Australia. Nauru Island is a detention facility for the refugees. The island is really far from the main island of Australia, so escape cant be an option. At the island the immigrants are questioned and sometimes beaten to get information out of them to make sure theyre not spies. Sometimes the families are separated from each other for questioning. Many people stay at the immigrant facility for an average of 3 years. The lowest someone has spent there time at the Island is 10 months. When the refugees are released many of them cant simply brush off their emotional scars that were made in the Nauru camps. They usually join the revolt against the detention facilities or tell the press about what's really going on inside the island. Many parents are shocked about how much the camps have changed their children over the years. Many have stated that their children were sweeter before, but after the experience they had they misbehave a lot, or become extremely depressed. Many people have tried to get rid of the camps and free the refugees, but the Australian government wont allow it. Nauru Island is not a simple detention facility, it is prision.

I believe that the people in Nauru island should be set free, because most of them have done nothing wrong and the amount of time each person has stayed there is way too long. I do agree they should be questioned, but in a more peaceful manner then sending them to detention facilities to be tortured. I say we give freedom to the families of Nauru, because sending them there just isnt right.

Article: Australia: Child survivors of Nepal earthquake 'being sold to British families'

Source: The Telegraph



The earthquake in Nepal killed 8,000 people and 21,000 were injured. This happened about a year ago and the people of Nepal are still struggle to rebuild what was once theirs. People still sleep in tents because there is too much crowding of rubble to rebuild still. Children who have no family members left and nowhere to turn to are sold to England. They are sold for 500,000 rupees which converts to 8 America dollars. The black market and many gangs are capturing homeless nepalese boys and girls and selling them. They are working as servants for wealthy British families. They are unpaid, but they do get a roof over their head. England things they are doing the right thing by giving them a home and something to do, but by doing this it is going against British law. A few agencies are trying to collect the children back because they think taking a child away and forcing away from their home country is juvenile. 

I think that the Nepal children should return back to their country because thats where they belong. The children can help rebuild Nepal with everyone else. Also even though they have no more family they might still have friendly neighbors and friends they don't want to part with. No one should be taken away from their home place and work as an unpaid slave. I believe everyone should have their own freedom in the world especially children.
