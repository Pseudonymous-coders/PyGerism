Article: Protesters demand release of detained Nigerian Shiite leader

In Nigeria the Nigerian Shiite Leader, a Man named Zakzaky, amongst many other people after military raids in north Zaria, killed hundreds of Zakzakys followers along with two of his children, but this was done without actual proof that he had done it. Zakzaky's Islamic Movement in Nigeria says that its members did not kidnap and kill a Nigerian army colonel the week before or that they tried to kill military chief General Tukur Buratai. On friday, March 25, protesters marched along the highways of Zaria, this was one of many protests recently. Zakzaky was not given a trial and people are demanding to give him a lawyer immediately. 



I believe this story affects many people, some of them were the ones that were killed during the movement and people who want to free Zakzaky from where he is being held. This relates to the Shakespearean play King Lear.
