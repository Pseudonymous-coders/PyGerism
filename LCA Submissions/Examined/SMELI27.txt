Article: US considers 'humanitarian parole' for Bangladesh bloggers facing imminent danger

In Bangladesh, Nazimuddin Samad (28 years old) was hacked, and shot to death in the streets of Dhaka.  Nazimmudin was a blogger.  He spoke out against radical islam.  Not only did this happen, but five other bloggers were also killed in a similar manner.  Because of this, the U.S.A is considering granting refuge to a number of Bangladeshi bloggers in danger from speaking out against radical islam.  Because of this, Karin Deutsch, a member of a U.S human rights group has asked the U.S.A to offer a humanitarian parole for the Bangladeshi in danger for speaking out.  If you did not know, a Humanitarian Parole is used to bring someone into the United States for a temporary period of time due to an emergency.  In this case, it would be getting murdered for speaking out.  Mark Toner, a state department spokesman heavily condemned the barbaric murder of Samad.  Since 1999, the number of asylum seekers in the united states from Bangladesh have increased by over a thousand!  Some of the Bangladeshi attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State, but however, the government declines those claims.  The government suggests that the Sunni extremist group has no presence in the country.  Followed by all of the given information, authorities in Bangladesh think that Samad was attacked because of the way he publicly spoke about atheism, and supporting capital punishment for war crimes. (During the countrys war with Pakistan).  No group has claimed responsibility for murdering Samad, a supporter of the prime minister.  Hasina's government set up unique tribunals to try war crimes cases. Hasina's government has accused the opposition of religious radicals it blames for the attacks on bloggers, minority Shiites, Christians and foreigners.  





In my beliefs, we should definitely start a humanitarian parole.  Because of the fact that the Bangladeshi are in danger,  it would be very smart to let them into our country temporarily.  By doing this, america could save lives.  In our remix of shakespeare, this event could be used as an example as a story somewhat like the hunger games.  People were killed for speaking out, and our trailer would be a fast paced-action sequence like drama.  There would be various gunshots to represent the people that were killed, a protagonist, and multiple antagonists.  These traits would be used to depict the harsh outcomes that happen in Bangladesh.  I think that the government should take authority more into this matter, and investigate how this is happening.  The USA sometimes does get too involved with other countries, personally I think that the US is going to choose to do humanitarian parole with Bangladesh.

Topic: Police hunt suspects in India temple fire that killed 110

On Monday, tons of medical units headed to the people hurt in a massive fire.  This fire killed over 110 people.  This terrible incident happened in a Hindu temple in southern India.  Police are currently searching for the group of people / person responsible for illegally putting these fireworks on display.  Police is also questioning five workers that were in charge of handling fireworks stored at the site.  The police were hoping to learn about the owner of the fireworks, how the display was contracted.  After the fire, many rescue officials stormed to the site of damage.  These officials searched through dust, wood, and even concrete to find out how this display was made before dawn.  Villagers and police had also had to find people from even slabs of concrete, and steel grinders.  Even though many people died, some were rescued and their lives were spared.  The Kollam District Hospital is swarmed with terrified relatives, the best that can be done is attempting to calm them down so they can give information.  A villager claims that it was a chaotic experience, the people were screaming, trying to find a way out of the dark.  No one knew how to find their way out of the building.  Apparently, most of the 110 deaths happened when the building holding the fireworks collapsed.  Even though many of these bodies have been identified, there are still 11 who have been damaged beyond recognition.  





I think that the police should team up to find out who the 11 bodies were, and find the people responsible for this event and send them to prison.  I think that other countries should donate money to pray for the 380 people hurt, and for the families of the 110 people killed.  This event affected more than a thousand people, and deserves much attention.  I do not think this can relate to a Shakespeare play / movie.  There is not a good behind it, just terrorism against innocent people. If there was a person speaking out against evil, like the first article, it would be different.  There not really a theme that can go behind this, this event was just a plain massacre for no good reason.

Topic: Forget the drought, Thailand's national water fight is on

As of 2016, Thailand is going through its driest times in 20 years.  Although there is a huge drought, this does not stop the people from celebrating the wet and wild street parties for the Thailand new year.  Many officials do not approve of this idea, and think that kids should be taught to preserve water.  The festival on the streets will be managed, but kids will be allowed to have just as much fun as they would on any other year.



In my opinion, I do not think that this event should remain continued.  Thailand has been in a severe drought for twenty years, and water should not be wasted on a fun tradition.  Even if this event was still continued, the water guns should be replaced with plant squirts, like another suggested.  Following this, I do not believe that this would match an event for a Shakespeare play at all.  There would be no plot, and this story is too happy anyway.  All stories need a little bit of death.
