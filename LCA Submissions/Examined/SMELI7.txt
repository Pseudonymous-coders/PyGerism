Shakespeare has been around for a very long time and people have been discovering his books and stories for many years. Now on his birth month people find his genuine first folio. Some are very excited about this and others say the expected better. Since this recent folio has been found, there are no 234 folios. The folio was found in a historic house on a Scottish island . This discovery just show us more the amazing, creative writer.



This whole article is on Shakespeare but enough knowledge on him to relate this to any of his plays. I think that this is interesting because shakespeare is very old and it's amazing how people still find his personal things.

Then terrorist group that struck Belgium 2 weeks ago ,ISIS, were planning to strike France first but then changed their minds. The reason they changed their minds was because authorities were closing on the investigation for Paris. The authorities would have started to investigate where they were headed next and that was France, but they knew they were almost done so they just bombed Belgium. 



Not enough knowledge on Shakespeare. I think that isis is stupid. Why would you kill yourself to kill more people. It wouldn't even be an accomplishment because you would be dead. People should be smarter and think before you do.







Topic:  Belgian Prime Minister: 'I don't accept' that an attack makes us 'a failed state'

The prime minister of Belgium says that he doesnt accept the fact that he has a failed state. Just because their state got bombed doesnt mean that they are weak or a failure. Belgium will rebuild and will continue to be a great state and will not be called a failure.





No enough knowledge on Shakespeare. I agree with the prime minister. I mean, it's not like it's his fault that they got bombed, you can't call a state a failure for being bombed that's just childish.
