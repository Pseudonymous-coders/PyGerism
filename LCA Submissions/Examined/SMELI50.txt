A magnitude 6.6 earthquake struck Afghanistan at 10:28 GMT close to the border with Tajikistan. The tremor was felt in Kabul, Islamabad, Lahore and Delhi, forcing residents to leave their homes. Earlier in October 2015, a magnitude 7.5 quake hit the same area and killed around 300 people. The recent quake hit in the luckily scarcely populated Hindu- Kush Mountains. 30 people have been injured and 1 dead but there is further risk of landslides causing homelessness and injuries. All the way in Delhi, the metro train systems was temporarily halted. The earthquake was felt in many surrounding countries and affected many lives. 





A possible story would be someone was living in the mountains and had a lover in another city and they get stuck and lose contact in the mountains after earthquakes and landslides. This is significant because this is a high frequency area that should be reinforced and earthquake procedures should be taught. Although not much can be done about the earthquakes, there could be actions taken for possible landslides.

Topic:Police seek 10 in connection with fire at Indian temple that killed 109 people

A fire broke out in an Indian temple that killed 109 people and injured over 500. The fire was caused by a festival fireworks being accidently set off. All the fireworks being set off caused an explosion that shook nearby houses. Most of the deaths were caused by either the initial fireball or the smoke inhalation and debris falling. The main temple/shrine was not damaged however. The temple also did not have permission to use fireworks and officials at the fireworks company were arrested. The 10 people suspected for setting off the fireworks are on the run currently. Family that had loved ones that passed were compensated and the injured were also compensated as well.



This reminds me a bit of Romeo, accidently killing and running from the law. It was a complete accident but still they are in trouble. I think that it was mostly the firework companies fault for selling them fireworks when they were not permitted to use them and they are in a dry area with lots of flammable materials.

An indian water train has relieved areas of severe drought in India. The train which was traditionally used for oil transportation has been steam cleaned and filled with water to be delivered to people in need. The trains are being filled in Miraj district in western Maharashtra. A government official has tweeted that more efforts will be made to help the people in need and in severe drought.



This is important because it shows how the government is really trying to help the people in need and when they want to do something they can do it. The drought might get worse over time as we get more and more carbon emissions and the temperatures rise even further. I dont think there is any way this can connect to Shakespeare.
