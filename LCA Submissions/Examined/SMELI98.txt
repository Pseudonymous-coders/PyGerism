This article is about brazil and how they are trying to get there current president out of the seat before his term is over. This is called impeachment and it's very serious and rare infact it only happened one time in the us. According to the president there is no reason to get rid of the president because he/she has never stolen nor committed a crime. Of course the lawyer always have to side with the person they are working for.



Brazilian media are reporting that more than 100 members of the 513-strong lower house are still undecided. But the decision must be made this week. This whole ordeal will affect everybody there including the people that like him and the people that dislike him. Either way somebody is gonna have to get something that they don't want.

So as we all know picking the president is one of the most talked about and biggest decisions that might just cause a fight. But what makes this election much more special is that is a women which isn't bad actually its about time for people to forget about those sexiest ways. Another thing is that she is winning by a lot against Mr Kuczynski he only have 22 percent of the votes.



Im sure that they both would be great president but she just stands out also because her dad was a former president. And everybody's always thinks that if your parents was good at something then you should be to or even better. And she is following in his footsteps!!!

A man named alfredo hawit was the former fifa corruption executive. He is believed to have got money and was transferring it to bank accounts out of new york. He is getting sued. The reason that this is so big because he is a public figure that did something wrong.



He is facing up to 20 years in jail for each count and 950k. At the end he was released from jail after not long. However he didn't leave without a consequence he is on a 1 million dollar bail bond which probably isn't very much for him.
