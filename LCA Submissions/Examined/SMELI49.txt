The Zika virus had an outbreak in Central and South America and any flights to those areas have been cancelled due to the virus affecting pregnant woman. People who have booked flights to these areas are being given full refunds or rebook the flight to any other country. The Zika virus is a disease that is spread to people by a bite of an infected Aedes species Mosquito. The symptoms of the virus is: Fevers, Joint pains, Red eyes and rashes. If a pregnant woman is bitten by a mosquito the baby will most likely have an abnormally small head. Zika Virus is an important topic, because its important so people can be alert with this virus, there is no treatment for it except some pain relievers. Informing the people first can make them take extra procedures to protect themselves from mosquitoes or other animals that can spread it to them. The Zika virus will spread eventually to other countries and we must make sure we can prevent it from infecting us.

          My personal belief on the Zika virus is that its a disease that should be taken seriously. In my opinion is that this disease should get studied so they can find a treatment for it so we can be protected against it. How it can be connected to Shakespeare is still not clear to me, but i may know how later on.

Article: Welcome to largest, legal marijuana field in Latin America

      A large field of Marijuana is legal in the Maule Region of Chile. It was officially inaugurated by the Daya Foundation, a non government organization that uses the legal marijuana to be used as a medical treatment. The medical Marijuana is used towards patients who have have serious diseases who have few options of treatment. Marijuana use is still illegal in Chile, but only the medical marijuana is treated to the patients that are suffering from chronic conditions on case-by-case basis.  The field will only be used for medical uses and no other use of it is allowed.  Having legal medical marijuana is very important, because it can help people who suffer from severe disease be treated with this medical plant. 



     In my opinion i agree with this use of marijuana, it is being used in a way that helps treat people. It is not used for anything else but for that one purpose only. The legal use of marijuana in medical use for patients who have chronic conditions is important so we can help them live with less pain in their conditions. I cant see how this can connect to Shakespeare.

     Donald Trump plans to block payments to mexico until Mexico pays for a border wall between the US and Mexico. Donald Trump wants to block money transfers to Mexico, money transfers is when a person who lives in the US sends money to Mexico, the money goes to the person they want to have the money. Many immigrants that come from mexico send money to their families back at mexico. If this gets blocked by Trump it will not allow anyone to send money to their families. It is a very serious issue that will affect thousands of people in the US. Money transfers to families in Mexico is very important to make sure they can help sustain their families in mexico. 



In my personal opinion I can relate to this topic, because my family those the same thing they send some money over there to help out their families. I find it very unfair that Mexico has to pay for a border wall that they dont even want. Donald trump shouldnt be forcing mexico to pay for something that he wants and then block payments that goes to families. It affects a lot of people and its unfair to them because they want to help their families but will not be able to do this. This can probably play in a remix of Shakespeare, but it might also not.
