Swedish Tourist Association, in celebration of their 250th anniversary ban on censorship, and to stir interest in Sweden, created the worlds first number for a country. Sweden has its own number. If you call it, you will be connected to a random Swede who volunteered for the service, on their app. Youre free to talk anything you want with the random Swede. Maybe, although no one is forcing you, should care about this so you can learn more about Sweden through a reliable source; the native themselves



Me, personally, myself and I, excluding from any external forces which may be upon me, dont care. This is the least thing I could care about. Out of all things, I dont wanna even think of this. Its very significant to me, personally, myself and I, and the excluded external forces. Also, maybe this is due to my lack of knowledge on Shakespeare and his plays, but I see no connection between this topic and Shakespeare, along with his plays.

Northeast has been hit with snow in the month of April. On the weekend of 9th and 10th, 78 million experienced 15 to 20 degrees below average and thick inches of snow, such as the 7.8 inch snow received in Toledo, Ohio. Cleveland got 4 inches and about 2,300 utility customers with power outages cause of the heavy snow. Some say its the lake-effect. But maybe you should care because a lot people are saying that snow is making their hometowns look beautiful. Take for instance this post. http://twitter.com/RobertWTOL/status/718684955388309504/photo/1 He takes a picture of his newly snowed road, and calls it beautiful. So, if you wanna go to a beautiful place this April, head on down to the Northeast. Its snowing. And you should go. Its a reason for you to care.



As for me, I personally believe snowing isnt good for you. Ive been told dont eat the snow, dont drink the snow, dont lick the snow e.t.c. So I never get to play with snow at all. And thats I say snowing is bad, which is my personal beliefs about the events in the article. And frankly, maybe this is due to my lack of knowledge on Shakespeare and his plays, but I see no connection between this topic and Shakespeare, along with his plays.

Couple a fools

Prank caller convinces Burger King workers to bust out windows

Various fast-food chains in Arizona, California, Oklahoma, and just recently Coon Rapids, Minnesota, fell victim to the same prank that may lead to felony charges. Employees are told, like the ones in Burger King on 4/8, there is a gas emergency in the building, and the only way vent the store is to smash all the glass. To give you an idea of how much the damage will cost, a similar prank at the Shawnee, Oklahoma Burger King cost that restaurant about $10,000. Maybe you should care because bad publicity for Burger King means less customers, which may lead to bankruptcy. Burger King, a beloved restaurant, could die because of mistakes like this. You dont want to see your possibly favorite restaurant to die, right? So then, you should care.



As for me, I think everything Burger King does suck. I also believe their food is fake. I also, also believe Chipotle is the new King of Fast Food. And, maybe this is due to my lack of knowledge on Shakespeare and his plays, but I can see a connection between Burger King and King Lear. Both were blind, Burger being blind to the prank, and Lear being blind for something else. Do we have something? Who knows.
