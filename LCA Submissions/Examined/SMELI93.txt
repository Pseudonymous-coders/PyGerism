Deputy president of kenya is case is dropped as well as some famous radio host. In 2008 after an election, people were killed, wounded raped and forced to flee. Judge declared mistrial because witnesses and judges were messing around.Some people from his home town are super happy that the deputy president. The television station think that the president got away with something he should have been punished for. The prosecutor (lawyer) had to stop the trial because they didnt have enough evidence. Also witnesses were threatened and bribed by government officials.



I think that the usa should not get into the other countries business. And to solve all their problem they should go shoot William ruto. 



I don't know which shakespeare play this relates to.

The African union killed six people from the shabab who have been terrorizing people in somalia for years.In an airstrike the pentagon killed a senior member of the shabab. People wonder how the battle strategy we are using will work. Since they fight back with more power in every attack. With all the attacks we inflict shabab seems to be having more deadly attacks. Since there are many well trained fighters that are willing to take the place of their dead work mates.They have been fought at since their government crashed. Warlords looking for power and resources.



I think to solve there problem they need give the people some of the things they want, so that they can work towards peace. Then they can become friends then the african union can then kill them.



I don't know which shakespeare poem this relates to.

In brazzaville ( capital of congo) armed people have been shooting up the police stations and mayor's office. All the shooting happened after the reelection of their president who has been in office since 1979. In last fall they changed term limits so that you could run for president past 70. After they announced that Mr. Sassou-Nguesso won the election. Mad protester have been attacking buildings. There are speculations that the attackers are from a one time militia from the civil war against Mr.Sassou-Nguesso.



I think that they should stop letting him stay president and move on to some other person as presidents. And they should teach their police to fight, so that they could catch the people that burned down the police stations.



I don't know how this relates to shakespeare's plays.
