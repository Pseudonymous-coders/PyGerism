How Pope Francis Amoris Laetitia Could Affect Families and the Church

Pope francis has passed a new document for the catholic church, called Amoris Laetitia which is latin for love is love. The new document is about same sex marriage, divorce and  remarriage, saying anyone can get married in the catholic church. This is a big step for the catholic church because it used to be only first time straight couples could get married in the catholic church. This affects every lgbt catholic and every catholic thats is remarrying.  

 I believe that this is a step forward for catholics and i hope the rest of christianity follows, but this is only a small step. The catholic church is big but will the rest of the religion follow, I hope so, i hope the whole world will follow the catholics in this new great acceptance. I can not think how this would relate to shakespeare.

Why the onslaught of religious freedom laws?

After the supreme court declared that same sex marriage is legal, many states were upset.  Mississippi has passed a religious freedom law saying that is you are a religious business you can deny to serve anyone that falls under the lgbt umbrella. Many other states are following in mississippis footsteps. This affects everyone in mississippi that works/owns a religious company and all the lgbt people living in mississippi.

I believe many non-religious companies will not serve lgbt people even though the law says you must be a religious company. This is wrong you shouldn't be able to not serve someone because of their beliefs. i believe this could be like segregation, not serving just because they way they are, they can't help it. I can't relate this to shakespeares works.

There is a terrorist group in africa, especially nigeria, young woman are being taken and trained to be suicide bombers. They are bombing schools and religious places. It's estimated that 105 girls have bombed places, this has affected so many families because there are the families of the girls that are taken, then the families of the people that were hurt or died in the bombings. 

I believe that this is horrible people being taken a forced to die and other people just dying because they are doing what they believe. I cant see how this relates to shakespeare.
