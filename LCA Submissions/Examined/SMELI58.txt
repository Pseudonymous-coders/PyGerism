Summary Paragraph

Self-driving trucks drove from factories in Sweden and southern Germany among other places all the way to Rotterdam on Wednesday April 6. Self-driving trucks on the road should help with Europes problem of congestion, as they wont cause accidental traffic jams through randomly slowing down. However, at the moment the trucks are not completely automated, and they still need to have human drivers on board; it will be a while until self-driving trucks are seen on the road. This seems to be both because of the level of technology needed to have a reasonably low risk of accidents, and because of the fact that regulations on self-driving vehicles are not standardised across the European continent.

Personal Beliefs Paragraph

While cutting down on congestion (and presumably accidents as well, since the self-driving trucks wont ever be tired when driving) is a good thing, self-driving trucks would also lower the amount of blue-collar jobs available, since that would reduce the amount of drivers needed to transport food and furniture and such cross country. So while its an amazing use of technology, and will make things easier for many people, it is also another step toward less people being able to get jobs simply because most jobs will necessitate being able to get a degree and work with high-level concepts.

Summary Paragraph

Britain is thinking about leaving the European Union because of the effect the EU is having on the National Health Service (NHS) of Britain. 

Both sides of the debate are concentrating on win/lose rather than salient facts such as: the details of what to do with the euro, how Europe is implementing democracy, and details of the economy, such how the steel industry of Britain is reliant on the EU as well as how decisions are made in the EU. Instead of talking about direct effects, the politicians are concentrating on emotional points, and only then moving onto the hard facts of the situation, meaning that they are left to scramble for hard evidence to support their position.

Personal Beliefs Paragraph

I think that the idea of focusing on win/lose rather than on what will actually happen if you win or lose is something that could work well in either an adaptation of Macbeth or King Lear, considering that in both plays the titular character decides his plan of action according to whether he wins or loses. For Macbeth, winning would be becoming king, and losing is simply staying as Thane of both Cawdor and Glamis. For King Lear, winning is having his three daughters fully devoted to him and losing is any of his daughters not being entirely devoted to him. In both cases, they dont consider the full situation.

Summary Paragraph

People from Central America are coming to the United States to protect themselves and their families before its too late to get through the border. When the people are apprehended by border patrol, they are taken to detention facilities so it can be established whether or not they have a plausible asylum case, a reasonable reason to flee their country in the hopes that the United States will offer them freedom. Typically they are then released, and go to live with family members who already made it to the USA. The process has gone from taking weeks, or even months, to taking just a few days, although the facilities themselves have apparently not improved. The people coming from Central America work hard to make it to the US, even though they know that they may be sent back right after their court appearance to establish the validity of their asylum case, as they have heard that the opportunity to make it into the US may be closing soon, and they dont want to miss the window of opportunity

Personal Beliefs Paragraph

The idea that the very thing meant to prevent something is what causes it to happen is one that might work very well in a adaptation of King Lear -- the idea that by attempting to prove his three daughters love him, he blinds himself to the fact that his two eldest are fully prepared to betray him if it means they get full control of the inheritance he has planned for all of them, or that his insistence on his daughters proving their loyalty is what gives them the conviction to betray him
