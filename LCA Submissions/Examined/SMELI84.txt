Article: Oil ends sharply higher after unexpected U.S. inventory drop

On March 30 the weekly government data showed a large and unexpected fall in U.S. crude inventories. Also is showed an increased demand for crude oil in refineries. The Energy Information Administration said that oil inventories lost 4.9 million barrels of oil in the week ending April 1.This decline was the biggest since around 1997 reported Bespoke Investment Group. Also the data shows that the refineries used 199,000 more barrels than the week before. They operated a around a 91.4% capacity the previous week. The refineries are wrapping up the spring turnaround season sooner than normal in anticipation of the high demand of gasoline in the summer. Some people hope that key global producers of oil may agree to production freeze later this month. Even though there are ever rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia over the issue. Prices rose when Kuwait showed confidence that people would move ahead with the proposal to limit crude oil output. Oil prices have been changing multiple times throughout the past couple of months due to the hope of there being a production freeze. Some experts are saying that if there is an arrangement on April 17 in Doha that it is highly unlikely that  it would fix the oversupply problem.



First I would like to say that I dont know all that much about Shakespeare. Also I dont think that Shakespeare wrote his plays about oil prices fluctuating due to more than expected use of oil. Yet again I dont know all that much about Shakespeare. It is also concerning how the oil industry is hanging in the balance of countries that are at each other's throats.

Article: Panama Papers: Putin associates linked to 'money laundering'

Eleven million documents have been released by Mossack Fonseca (a panamanian law firm) to a German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung (a german newspaper.) Then the papers were shown to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalist. The documents have shown that the law firm has been helping clients launder money, dodge sanctions, and evade taxes. The number one suspect is the concert cellist Sergei Roldugin. He has know Vladimir Putin since they were teenagers and he is the godfather to the president's daughter Maria. Mr. Roldugin has made hundreds of millions of dollars from the suspicious deals. Papers from his companies however say that they have to protect the confidentiality of the ultimate owner of the company. Even though he says that he is no businessman. Some are starting to suspect that he is acting as a front man for someone else. One example of these transactions is when Sandlewood Continental bought something for one dollar and then later sold it for 133 mill dollars. Also Sandlewood was given a 800 mill dollar loan from a Russian State Bank with nothing in the documents show that they were paying it back. Tom Keatinge runs a Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies. He said that the transaction is most likely a  way to launder money. In 2007 one of Mr. Roldugin companies (International Media Overseas) borrowed 6 mill. After three months the loan was paid off with just one dollar. Again in 2011 IMO bought rights interest and repayments to a 200 mill dollar loan. Yet again the company only paid a dollar for the loan. IMO was also part of a scheme that made profit when a broker bought shares to the company who then sold it the next day back to them for half the price. Then the company made more profit where share trades were canceled and they were paid for the for their lost time. The documents also show that another one of his companies (Sonnette Overseas) has some private interest in Kamaz. In 2008 the company paid 1.5 mil to enter a consortium that had an option to buy a company that owned part of Kamaz. Some are thinking that Sandalwood is at the center of the money laundering ring.



This story shows a little about Macbeth. Granted I know only a little about Macbeth, but Mr.Roldugin was just a cellist until he used his contacts in the Russian Government. He used them to gain more fortune while bringing others down until the panama papers came out and he is under investigation.

Article: Claims of a Ponzi Scheme in the Collapse of a Rare-Wine Seller

A wine store in Berkeley Cal looks like any other wine store for wealthy people. It doesnt just sell wine from the store though. They built a multimillion dollar company selling wine to many collectors and over the internet. Now some people think that it might be one of the biggest Ponzi scheme ever. January of this year the company filed for bankruptcy. The company has $70 mill of debt and only $7 mill in assets. With 9,000 victims wondering what happened to $60 mill. Last month the F.B.I started an investigation for a Ponzi scheme in Premier Cru. The Co-founder and owner of the company John Fox invoked the Fifth amendment on his financial details on the bankruptcy. Premier Crus crash sent shock waves through the collectable market because wine is an investment that will gain value over time. Some people didnt even get the wine that they ordered like Thomas Booth. He says that he did get his wines that he order until around 2010. Many other people have had problems like Mr. Booth many have sued the company in January. The people that have lost the most are from China. The losses start from $660,000 to $981,000. The Bankruptcy trustee and the investigators have found nothing on how Mr. Fox or his associates were able to spend all the money.



I can see how this might be able to correlate with Macbeth. You could put him as a average level employee and have him make a big break for the company. Then he gets promoted to a high level position. Next he is told he can make billions he starts to go crazy and he begins a Ponzi scheme. He continues the scheme until the F.B.I starts on his trail. He sets off the scheme and vanishes with all the money leading the F.B.I on a trail around the world only to be caught and put in prison.
