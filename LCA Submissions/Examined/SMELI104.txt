Summary

Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, claims that the US is using the Panama Papers to weaken Russia, even though he has absolutely no information to back it up. He also talks about his friend, a well renowned cellist, who agrees with him.

The US had no intention of weakening Russia with the Panama Papers. I think Putin is just trying to turn other countries against the US using his crazy theories.

Summary

Flight maps show that FBI planes with tracking equipment and mufflers are circling some american cities. We dont know why they are doing this, but some of the locations are close to areas that had attacks in the last few years, and areas with large muslim populations. Over 100 flights have been tracked in areas across over 11 states in just under a month. Some people are also fighting back saying that we shouldnt be worried because America is doing everything we can to protect our people.

The US government is just doing their job to protect the American citizens. While not everyone likes the idea of spy planes with cameras and tracking equipment of them, chances are they are not spying on regular citizens, rather people who could be a risk to the safety of Americans. Yes they probably are racial profiling, but what are they going to do with that information?

My opinions on each of the candidates:



Hillary- Idiot who is using her gender to manipulate people (specifically other women) into voting for her. She is always trying to keep with the current times, but doesnt know what shes doing.



Bernie- A fowl old man who thinks the US has an unlimited amount of money. What he is saying will be free for everyone could never happen. Manipulates teens.



Donald- Evil sadist who hates women. Somehow still in the lead? Wants to use the USs money to build a wall (which will never work).



Cruz- Alright guy who has the skills to make a difference. Downsides: incompetent & the Zodiac Killer (JK)
