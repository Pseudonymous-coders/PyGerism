Article: China is the world's top executioner, but it doesn't want you to know that

Approximately 1,634 people were executed in 2015. This is the highest number of executions recorded globally since 1989, but almost 90% of these executions happened in Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. This data doesnt include China due to the refusal of Chinese authorities to make their statistics public. Many of these countries prisoners are typically executed with the use of lethal injection, beheading, hanging, or shooting. China is believed to execute more people than any other country. It is said that the number of executions in China is three times as many as the rest of the world combined. The number of executions in China have remained high, but has moderated its use of death penalty over the years leading to fewer executions. In 2011, China banned the use of capital punishment against offenders over 75 and removed 13 offences from the list of 68 crimes punishable by death.  



I agree and believe with this article that China should make their death penalties public; meaning China should share their statistics about the executions happening in their country.  The types of of crimes punishable by death is unbelieveable. This article makes me wonder why people continue to do these crimes if they know itll only lead to capital punishment. Having a powerful government official who dictates the fate of these prisoners will be a great way to set up a general consumed by ambition in the tragedy, Macbeth.

Article: Hundreds hurt in police clashes at Greece-Macedonia border

Many refugees attempt to enter Macedonia only to be pushed back with tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades. More than 300 people were treated; many people had open wounds from rubber bullets as well as respiratory problems resulting from tear gas. More than a million people have entered Europe, mainly through Greece. Many people believe that the Macedonian Border Guards shouldnt have used such force on the people. Since there was limited resources to house migrants, Macedonia had to close the border last week only to open it but with more stricter controls, only allowing a few hundred to pass through. Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia have all announce that theyll accept fewer than 600 migrants and refugees a day but on Monday they only allowed 50 people. So far, more than 100,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Greece in the first two months of this year. 



Due to all of the refugees and migrants, Its not a surprise how they acted the way they did at the Greece-Macedonia border. I believe that the Macedonian authorities shouldve handled that situation differently since there were so many refugees and migrants there. This article would be a perfect way to set up Twelfth Night, Viola being disguised as a boy finding her lost lost brother, Sebastian while both characters are refugees trying to get across the border.

Topic: Prostitution 



Article: France: Prostitution now legal, paying for sex illegal

Date: 4/7/16

The supporters of this controversial topic in France believe that the clients of the prostitutes are the real criminals; while the opponents believe that this law is unlogical. This article is about the legalization of prostitution in France as well as the law making paid sex services illegal. By placing this bill, countries like France, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and the UK hope to prevent prostitution as well as sex trafficking. By placing these laws, these workers will no longer be fined or jailed for public soliciting, but will face fines and mandatory classes.



I agree with this article that this prostitution bill is a good thing as well as the clients being guilty. There are 5 European countries that have passed this bill, but why hasnt more countries passed it too if people really wanted to get rid of trafficking, and prostitution? Since there are fines placed on paying for sex services, I believe that this will put workers at risk because these services will continue to happen since this law wont fully prevent prostitution. I have no ideas of how I can incorporate this with Shakespeare..
