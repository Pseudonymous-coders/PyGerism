In this this article they explain how Sebastien Bellin, a 6-foot-9  giant once celebrated for his skills on the basketball court, but now lays in a hospital bed with an injured leg. Bellin was one of the 130 people who were injured. Although he didnt have the most severe injury of the 130 other people he is serving as an inspirational figure to most because he is a famous basketball player. His optimistic personality has inspired many to brave on, and helps both the victims and their families. This is very important because this man has become the light at the end of the tunnel for so many families and without him it would be very difficult for many families. His injury caused him to lose 50 percent of his blood, but he remained conscious throughout and kept pushing for treatment. A triple helping of pasta carbonara the night before had kept his blood sugar up, preventing him from passing out.

 

I believe that Bellin has proven that no matter what the situation you can always make it through as long as you stay optimistic and positive. It also shows how even strangers are willing to help someone theyve never met in their life. This affects way more than 500 people because he has inspired the families of the 140+ people who were affected by this event.

Article: Russian S-300 air defence missiles 'arrive in Iran'

Date: April,11,2016

Russia has lifted a ban on supplying Iran with a sophisticated air defence missile system. The delivery of the S-300s was cancelled in 2010 after the UN imposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.But the Russian president gave the go-ahead after Tehran struck an interim deal with world powers to curb nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. However the US and Israel do not support this.The S-300 is a surface-to-air missile system that can be used against multiple targets including jets, and missiles. This is why the US and Israel are very unsupportive of Iran receiving multiple S-300s. Also Iran has a history of making nuclear weapons so the US has been keeping tabs on them.



This affects a lot of people because everyone in that area is paranoid that they could be bombed, and the US has to decide if they are going to let them keep the S-300s or if they are going to take them which can result in conflict.

Article: Rockets fired from Syria hit Turkey, wounding at least 4

On monday five rockets from Syria landed in a Turkish border town Kilis wounding at least four people, and four days earlier they were hit by two rockets which also injured two people. Last month two people including a four year old boy, were killed by rockets fired from IS-controlled territory across the border(IS is short for Islamic State).



This affects many people because these two countries could go to war which can result in many people getting injured or killed.Also I think its really dumb that they are just firing missiles in that border town. This reminds of the article where Iran is getting missile launchers, and now I can see the damage that they can do and why the US and israel are concerned about the S-300s.
