Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule 1 drug, which means that it has a very high potential for abuse and no medical use. This means that performing medical experiments with marijuana can be slow, with approval taking between 6 to 18 months. The heads of the DEA, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of National Drug Control Policy signed a letter to Congress stating that they have received recommendations from health and scientific organizations as well as from the Department of Health and Human Services to reclassify marijuana. The DEA proposes to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug, which makes it much easier to conduct medical studies on the effects of it and sends a message that marijuana still has some medical value. Various groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Epilepsy Foundation of America have come out in support of this change. However, despite this letter,some people remain skeptical, as the DEA has only reclassified drugs 5 times before, and the current administrator of the DEA remains an opponent. 



I believe that loosening regulations of marijuana can be good, especially since current research indicates that marijuana can have a lot of potential applications in treating conditions such as seizures, stress, etc. Reclassifying it can help make research easier to conduct, while still making sure that it cannot be easily abused. I believe that people who are opposed to this measure should reconsider their choices, as their decision is based on decades of incorrect information.

An arm of the Energy Department, the Energy Information Administration, has been investigating why fuel prices are high despite record low oil prices. They found that the EPA is responsible, since they have created laws forcing car companies to design car engines that meet higher environmental standards. Car manufacturers compensate by shrinking engines and increasing turbocharging, but that requires more expensive fuel, thus the high prices.



I think that the EPA is justified in doing this. Their job is to protect the environment, and paying a little higher price is worth saving the environment. This is especially important in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal. I do not know about Shakespeare to draw any similarities between this article and Shakespeares works.

Article: Duke protesters reject university president's proposed minimum wage hike

Students at Duke University have been participating in a sit-in at the schools administration to force the school to raise minimum wages and improve working conditions. The president, David Brodhead, sent a letter to the campus saying that the school proposes to raise the minimum wage to $12 over the next few years. Within 30 minutes, the students rejected the offer, reiterating that the minimum wage should instead be raised to $15 over the next few years. The protest has shut down the administration building for the past few days, and 8 students remain.



I applaud the courage of the students, but I personally believe that $12 is enough already. They are getting too greedy, and instead they should compromise. Nevertheless, since they already rejected the offer, I believe that they should stay until they achieve their goals.
