The Kremlin in Russia has created a new word, Putinphobia, saying that the claims made by journalists about Putins involvement in the panama papers were false. The Russian government says that the claims that Putin storing money overseas are part of an attempt to undermine his presidency. The papers released papers also include 12 other former or current world leaders. Since the release, the prime minister of Iceland has resigned. The Kremlin has said that the public should not expect a similar dethronement. Studies show that the russian population has become accustomed to reports of corruption in Putins inner circle and these leaks will not affect Putin in the polls. In the past estimates of his personal fortune were around $40 billion but now they are closer to $200 billion. Now neither of these number have any evidence. In fact there is not much evidence of anything because none of the released documents have his name on them. Most of the accusations against Putin have been made on the basis that many of the people in his inner circle were included in the documents.



I think that Putin is lying about not being involved with the leaks. Ultimately i think that we need wait and find out more till i will feel safe making a side. Also i don't think we know enough yet to put it into a play.

Recently a company in the philippines has released the first ever vaccine to dengue fever. Dengue fever is potentially deadly disease that affects as many as 390 million people per year and kills over 250,000. Although it is now commercially available it is only being administered to high-risk people. Researchers predict the number of cases will decrease by 24% over the next five years.



I think that this achievement is very a important in medical research. I also think that this will lead to more powerful and more types of vaccines. This could be incorporated into a play by having the vaccine save the lives of someone who was going to die.
