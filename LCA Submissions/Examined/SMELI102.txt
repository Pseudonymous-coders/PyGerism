Summary: 



On the twenty-second of March three attacks occurred in Brussels, the Capital of Belgium. This city is very major because it host the seats of the members of the EU. The EU (European Union) is a union that helps keep Europe stable in terms of money, living standards, and people. Thirty-two people were killed and over three hundred were injured. On the seventh of April, it was confirmed that one of the bombers worked in the EU on part time jobs and summer jobs. The worker was identified as Najim Laachraoui. This situation brought up accusations of Belgium being very relaxed when it comes to terrorist attacks and threats, some called Belgium a failed state. The prime minister of Belgium did not admit to this, trying to fight this statement with by bringing up the times he defended Belgium from terrorist attacks and denied that Belgium is a failed state. The Belgian government counteracted this argument by making thirty measures for safety, including the ban of prepaid cellphone cards. The Belgian government did this to insure life will go back to normal in Brussels and Belgium. 



Beliefs of Article and Incorporation with Shakespeare:



I believe Belgium is doing the right thing in this type of situation and is doing the right thing for the people of Belgium by making the thirty measures. The Brussels attacks could fit well with Macbeth, because Brussels is a place of politics and the terrorists might have pinpointed it because of political differences and beliefs.

Summary: 



After the shutting down of the main route Muslim migrants used to get to Germany, many migrants flocked to the islands of Greece. Greece has hardened when it comes to migrants coming to Greece. Kasidiaris of the Golden Dawn and a member of the Greek Parliament states that they dont want to be the minority in their own land. He agrees with Trumps policies of keeping the Muslim immigrants out, and says that great things will happen if he is president. So the migrants were greeted to the land of Greece with tear gas. Instances of this were caught on tape, showing the migrants running away from clouds of tear gas. Migrants were hospitalized by the Doctors Without Border organization who treated many people suffering from tear gas, including children. Many migrants prove to be resistant and wont give up on coming to Greece, no matter how tough police are on them.



Beliefs of Article and Incorporation with Shakespeare:



I get why Greece is taking this the way they are, but to me its a little harsh. It just doesnt sit well with me. I dont see this current event fitting with any of the Shakespearean plays.

Summary: 



Jakarta, a city of twenty-three million, becomes worse when the governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama temporarily suspended the Three-In-One rule to help private drivers get to their destination more quickly, but this didnt help at all. In fact, it made the traffic worse. The Three-In-One rule is a rule that doesnt allow private drivers with more than three passengers onto main roads. This suspension made a flurry of car jockeys spawn. Car jockeys are like taxi drivers, but usually pay less. Car jockey passengers include, children, people working alone, and mothers with babies. Kids were labeled as Passengers for Hire. Some car jockey passengers swindle kids into paying more money to reach their destination. Many parents are taking advantage of the kids to make more money to buy cellphones or go shopping.  A bus driver complains and says that the suspension has been making his job a lot harder and that the pay of his job is getting weak. The situation does not only make his job harder but many other peoples jobs harder too. The situation is making it harder for people to be on time and theyre getting frustrated because they are receiving lesser amounts of pay. People are outraged and urging the government of government to come up with a solution in order to fix this. 



Beliefs of Article and Incorporation with Shakespeare:



I agree with the people of Jakarta that this situation must be fixed and the governor needs to lift the suspension of the Three-In-One rule. I dont see this situation fitting into Shakespeare. If I had to pick which one it would fit best, I would say Macbeth.
