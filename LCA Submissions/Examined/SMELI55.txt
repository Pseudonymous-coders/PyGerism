With its newest update the messaging app Whatsapp added end-to-end encryption to messages, file transfers, and voice calls. If the messages are hijacked by anyone, including the DoJ and law enforcement, they cannot be read or decoded. The messages are encoded at the sender's phone and can only be decoded at the receiver's phone. Not even Whatsapp itself can see the messages. The move has been praised by Amnesty International and security professionals, while being disapproved by all levels of government. The government says that this puts peoples lives at risk as many terrorist groups use these encrypted messaging apps to communicate.



  I think that the government shouldnt care so much about trying to get our information as most people are law abiding citizens. I wouldnt want to know that someone could always go through my conversations and calls. There could be personal information on it. I dont think there is any way to make a correlation to a shakespearean play with this story.

Article: Rocket strikes in Kabul intended for John Kerry, Taliban say

John Kerry, the US Secretary of State, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. He left barely an hour before rockets were fired in the  Afghan capital where he was. He was there to try and diffuse problems with intergovernmental squabbles in which two major figures have a large rivalry. There have been multiple resignations by ministers and other senior officials. Polls show the general public of Afghanistan does not approve of the two leaders. Taliban took full responsibility for the attempt. They have been rebuilding over the past few years and are now gaining ground in the helmand province of afghanistan. The afghan army is now trying to retake their lost land. 

I believe that the threat of terrorist groups to US citizens is highlighted here. A senior official is directly targeted by the Taliban in an effort to kill him. I think we need to put more effort towards attacking terrorist groups that pose an imminent threat to innocent people. I dont see how this could connect to a play by Shakespeare.

Article: Base shooting victims ID'd as former FBI agent, squadron commander

On Friday there was a murder-suicide at the Lackland Air Force Base. 2 people were killed, one of which was a former FBI agent. No motive has been found. There were 2 pistols found at the scene. The Bexar County Sheriffs Office handed the investigation over to military and federal investigators. The base was immediately locked down and searched for an hour before returning to normal activity. Similar murder-suicide shootings have occurred in recent years such as the shooting on the Fort Hood base.



I think that we need to take better care of our military personnel and vets. They put their lives on the line to protect others. They shouldnt be put through so much stress that something like this would happen. There should be better counseling available to personnel. I dont see anyway to connect this to a shakespearean play.
