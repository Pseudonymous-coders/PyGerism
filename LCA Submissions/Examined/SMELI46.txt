Minimum Wage

California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill Monday that intends to provide the Golden State with the richest minimum wage.

The law sets a $15 minimum wage in California by 2022 for businesses with more than 25 employees and by 2023 for smaller firms. The phase-in will begin next year when the rate increases to $10.50 an hour from $10 an hour.

But the law comes with a significant caveat: A governor can halt increases in the event of a recession or budgetary downturn.

New York is close on Californias heels. Last week, lawmakers there approved a $15 hourly wage in New York City by 2019 for businesses with 11 or more employees and by 2020 for others. Suburbs would reach $15 in 2022. Minimum pay in upstate New York would climb to $12.50 an hour in 2021, then rise based on a formula until it reaches $15. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton plan a victory rally in Manhattan on Monday.

The laws could have a broad impact. Last year, 53.6 million workers in the U.S. were paid less than $15 an hour, including nine million in New York and California.

Earlier this year, Oregon lawmakers approved a $14.75 wage for the Portland area, and a somewhat lower rate in other parts of the state. Meanwhile, 21 other states follow the federal mandate of $7.25 an hour.

A bill (law) was recently passed in New York, and California, increasing the amount of pay people can get at minimum(That's what minimum wage is).This bill will change the lives of millions of americans living in New York and California, because even though getting 15 dollars an hour will make it easier for people to get on their feet with a temporary job, this will damage the value of the dollar greatly in these areas (it will cost more money to buy stuff), and it will also make it more difficult for these people to get start a business, or get a job where the pay is high enough that the work ethic compensates for the pay(Jobs where you dont work your butt off for very little money). The idea of having a high minimum wage may seem like a good idea at first glance, but in reality it has many cons that are not worth taking. The minimum wage will slowly increase over a 7 year period where in 2022 it will have reached 15 dollars in New York and California. (This means that the minimum wage in California and New York is 9 dollars right now)

In my personal opinion, I do not think it is necessary to have a 15 dollar minimum wage, because minimum wage jobs are not supposed to be sustaining jobs for a person living on their own; you should not be working at minimum wage if you live on your own, or if you're paying the bills. Minimum wage jobs are meant for teenagers, so it is not necessary to raise the minimum wage and damage the economy. This is not related to shakespeare in any way.

U.S. Navy Officer

A U.S. Navy officer with access to sensitive U.S. intelligence faces espionage charges over accusations he passed state secrets, possibly to China and Taiwan, a U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the suspect as Lieutenant Commander Edward Lin, who was born in Taiwan and later became a naturalized U.S. citizen, according a Navy profile article written about him in 2008.

A redacted Navy charge sheet said the suspect was assigned to the headquarters for the Navy's Patrol and Reconnaissance Group, which oversees intelligence collection activities.

The charge sheet redacted out the name of the suspect and the Navy declined to provide details on his identity.

It accused him twice of communicating secret information and three times of attempting to do so to a representative of a foreign government "with intent or reason to believe it would be used to the advantage of a foreign nation."

The document did not identify what foreign country or countries were involved.

The U.S. official said both China and Taiwan were possible but stressed the investigation was still going on.

The suspect was also accused of engaging in prostitution and adultery. He has been held in pre-trial confinement for the past eight months or so, the official added.

USNI News, which first reported Lin's identity, said he spoke fluent Mandarin and managed the collection of electronic signals from the EP3-E Aries II signals intelligence aircraft.

The U.S. Navy profiled Lin in a 2008 article that focused on his naturalization to the United States, saying his family left Taiwan when he was 14 and stayed in different countries before coming to America.

"I always dreamt about coming to America, the 'promised land'," he said. "I grew up believing that all the roads in America lead to Disneyland."

The Navy's article can be seen here: 1.usa.gov/1SIEJDe

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he was not aware of the details of the case. He did not elaborate. China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it had no information on the case. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry declined to comment.

The article is about a man who is under investigation by the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies (The 16 intelligence agencies are basically a bunch of people who spy on us to make sure nothing bad happens) on if he had given information to the chinese government, or the taiwanese government. The man had been previously accused of engaging in prostitution and adultery (This basically means cheating on your wife in a nutshell). Both the Taiwanese and Chinese government refuse to comment on the subject, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that he was not aware of the situation, or aware of the details of the case (Nobody knows if hes lying or not). He did not elaborate past that. This man was part of the U.S. navy, and had been in 14 other countries before joining the navy. (This means he could be affiliated with other countries)

In my opinion, I think the man under investigation should be discharged until there is hard evidence concerning whether he is affiliated with the chinese/taiwanese government. I do not see any correlation between this and shakespeare's plays.

Electric Chair

Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe said on Monday he would not sign a bill passed by the legislature that would order executions by electric chair when lethal-injection drugs are not available.

McAuliffe is recommending instead that state prison officials be allowed to purchase lethal drugs for executions on an emergency basis, with the identities of the pharmacies providing the drugs to be kept secret.

"These amendments deliver a valid path forward to continue VA's capital punishment policy," McAuliffe said on Twitter.

"Our citizens share my concerns and do not wish to be forced into using this terrible form of punishment," he said, referring to the electric chair.

Corrections Department officials have said lethal-injection drugs have become more difficult to obtain with drug companies increasingly unwilling to sell them because they do not want to be associated with the death penalty.

Some 300 U.S. religious leaders last week urged McAuliffe to veto the bill, calling it a "barbarous relic" in an open letter.

McAuliffe, a Democrat, told reporters Monday that if he vetoed the electric-chair bill it would essentially shut down capital punishment in Virginia, and the Republican-dominated legislature would have to accept his amendments to the bill.

Lawmakers reconvene on April 20 to consider the governor's vetoes and recommendations.

The electric-chair issue created controversy over whether it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

Currently, state law gives condemned inmates the choice between the electric chair and injection. Unless an inmate chooses the electric chair, the states only option is lethal injection.

Last year, Virginia obtained vials of pentobarbital from Texas to execute Alfredo Prieto for murder.

Two executions were scheduled in Virginia this year but each led to a stay in federal court and no executions are currently scheduled.

In January, the Virginia Department of Corrections said it did not have enough of a certain drug to carry out a lethal-injection execution that had been scheduled for March of Ricky Javon Gray.

Gray, 39, was convicted of the New Years Day 2006 murders of Bryan Harvey, 49; Kathryn, 39; and their daughters, Stella, 9, and Ruby, 4 in Richmond.

The governor of virginia has recently refused to sign a bill which would allow the use of an electric chair as an execution device (An execution device is something used to kill people when necessary). The governor does not believe it is correct for someone to use an electric chair as an execution device, stating that he people of virginia should not have to fear for the use of an electric chair. The governor said that lethal injection is the only option for people do die by if they receive a death punishment (This is when they basically give you a poison that is painless to kill you). There were numerous people in virginia who were going to die by the electric chair, but now that this bill has been refused to be passed by the governor, these people will be executed by lethal injection. (The reason they arent given a choice is because the governor thinks its unethical to execute someone using an electrical chair.)

In my opinion, the death sentence is not ethical to begin with, but if it must happen, people should be allowed to choose between if they want to die by injection, or the electrical chair. In the shakespeare play, henry garrett did not get to choose how he wanted to die. This makes the shakespeare play related to this story.
