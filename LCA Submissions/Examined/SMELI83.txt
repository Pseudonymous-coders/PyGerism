Late Wednesday evening a man lies dead a street after being attacked by machetes and then shot, according to the police. The victim is identified as 28 year old Bangladesh student, Nazimuddin Samad. Although the police doesnt have any suspects, they believe that religious extremists are involved in the murder of Nazimuddin Samad. I have no religion is what Nazimuddin Samad wrote on his Facebook profile page under religious views, and police thought that was the reason why he was killed. There were also related killings like this that happened in Bangladesh over the past year. Last year 4 prominent were killed secular bloggers were killed with machetes, then 2 foreigners, a Italian worker and a Japanese man, were shot dead in a random attack. The so-called Islamic State group claimed that they are responsible for the killings of these people, but they cant be verified. 



Even though there had been multiple killings that happened in Bangladesh over the past year, the Bangladesh government hasnt done anything about it. The citizens of Bangladesh are constantly living in fear that they might be attacked by religious extremists because they arent living the religion that they want to. They cant live freely and are constantly hiding from the outside. The religious extremist can be Romeos family side and Juliets side can be the citizens of Bangladesh, both of them are always fighting each other.

After weeks and weeks of protestings by women activist, the Shani Shingnapur temple now allows women to go in the temple to pray with the men. The Shani Shingnapur temple is one of the few temples in the Indias western Maharashtra state that stills preserve the traditions and to have a new rule change, some people are really mad about it. Every time the women tries to enter the temple to pray, they would always be forced out by the men. It got so out of control, the Bombay High court got involved. The court affirmed the right for women to enter and pray in the temple along with the men. The court also made a new law stating that whoever tries to prevent women from entering the temple, they will be giving a six-month jail sentence. Even with the new law in place, the men still dont follow the law. For example last week when a group of females tried to enter the shrine, they were blocked by a group of men. 



This new change has affected hundreds and maybe even thousands of people in the western Maharashtra state of India. The Hindus have been following a tradition for thousands of years, and to have it change unexpectedly is too much for them. If they allow the women to enter the temple, they are going against a big tradition they had and been following for thousands of years. That is why the men are fighting back, they dont to go against the traditions of the Hindu religion. There isnt a Shakespeare story related to this news article.

Yesterday night, there was a big festival at a Hindu temple in the Indian state of Kerala. During the festival, the all the fireworks exploded and killed over a 100 people and injuring over more than 200 people. The explosion happened at about 3:30 (22:00 GMT Saturday), just hours after the festival started. The temple caught on fire and collapsed while hundreds of people were inside the temple. After the chaos, doctors and the rescue team has a rough time helping the injured people and recovering the dead bodies. Those who were injured had serious burn injuries to them, and those who are dead were so burnt that they can only be identified with DNA testing. Even the people who werent at the temple got killed or critically injured because of the explosion. When the temple exploded, debris from the temple flew about 1km away from the scene. A biker was hit by a flying piece of concrete, and that concrete was a piece of the temple.



The temple explosion had affected so much people in the area. People began to question about having the fireworks at a festival and what safety precautions were used during the night of the explosion. An investigation has been ordered to determine what exactly caused the fireworks to set off and what to do to prevent it from happening in the future. This story isnt relatable to a Shakespeare story.
