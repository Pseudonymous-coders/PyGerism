Topic: Religious Freedom V Gay Rights

Date:Thu April 7, 2016

Over the past few years, all the way to now, many religious freedom bills have been popping up. Many states have statewide proposals that keep open the choice to discriminate against people due to religious beliefs. This story goes over state legislation and court rulings of court cases in which the conflict is religious freedom v gay rights. Small family owned businesses, and a few corporate businesses want to have the right to deny services to people in the LGBT community. This article goes over what religious freedom means, and what equality means. Even though last summer The United States supreme court gave same-sex couples the right to marry legally, there have been people denied a marriage licence due to people saying it is their religious freedom to deny the services. This story is important because it is a battle between rights. The first amendment gives people freedom of religion and the right to practice so freely. The ninth amendment states that freedoms not listed in the bill of rights are still rights, this amendment left up to interpretation of what someone views as a right. The tenth amendment says that if the constitution does not delegate a right for interpretation that it is left up to a state, of by the people. This is truly amendment v amendment, it is still in debate, and always will be.

I believe there is a fine line between religious freedom and discrimination. I get wanting freedom to perform religious practices, but I dont think denying someone service is a freedom left to religion. People in the LGBT community arent asking for special freedoms, they are asking for equal rights, such as marriage, bathroom accommodations, services, and ect. I am on the side of the LGBT community on this. There is a fine line between discrimination and religious freedom.

University Students Dead in Louisiana Shooting

April 11th, 2016

ABC News



Two 19 year olds from Southern University who were a part of the schools athletic program, were killed in a shoot outside of a Baton Rouge apartment complex. Police have arrested one of two men suspected in the shooting, Ernest Bernard Felton,22, of Miami, is facing charges of attempted second degree murder.  People were there for a party at the apartment complex, near LSUs campus when the 24 year-old man drove up in his car. Police believe the shooting started up from a previous argument. Benton and January, the two 19 year olds, were shot around 2am during the shootout between the 24 year old, and Felton. A candlelight vigil was planned for Tuesday at the Southern campus.

I think it is very sad that something like this happened. I think having better safety precautions in situations like this are very necessary, and times like this are learning experiences. I think this could story does say something about who we allow to have guns, it shows that we need to have a better process to get a gun, so people cant do things like this. This also says something about the complex in which this happened. There should be better and safer precautions in places like this, so tragic events like this dont happen.

Spate of suicide attempts leaves Canadian indigenous community reeling

April 11, 2016

CNN



After 11 attempted suicides in a canadian city, the county has called for an official state of emergency. 28 residents of Attawapiskat attempted suicide in March, and 100 since August the youngest being 11, and the oldest being 71. This article goes over the facts of mental health in Canada, saying that they believe that these attempts have been due to overcrowding, bullying, addiction, and the continuing impact of residential schools.

I believe it is very sad that this is happening in the world. I believe talking about these issues and helping people is the only way to solve the problem. This is a tragedy that could have been prevented if enough people had actively been focused on the mental welfare of the general population. Suicide is a sad and preventable thing, I think we should focus on mental health of people, more and actively.
