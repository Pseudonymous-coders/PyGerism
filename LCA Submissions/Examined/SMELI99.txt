Louisiana governor signs order giving some protection to the LGBT community. 



Louisiana Governor, John Bel Edwards, signs an order for protection on people of the LGBT community. There had been violence against people of LGBT which led to the signing of this order. The order helps LGBT people get the same treatment as as everyone else. 



I think that this is a good order. Its promoting equality which is all everyone hears about nowadays. Everyone should be equal.                                                    





Prostitution is legal in France now, while paying for sex isnt.



The French National Assembly made paying for sex illegal. This means that the person paying the prostitute would be the only one to get in trouble and fined if they were caught in the act. Because of this new law, paying for sex is becoming a lot more expensive. Some of the prostitutes clients can be fined 1,500 (1,700 US Dollars). Clients that keep buying sex can be fined double that. 



This law seems pretty dumb. Someone tweeted This anti-prostitution law is as if we allowed bakers to display their cakes but didn't allow people to buy them., and i agree. Both of them are guilty.
