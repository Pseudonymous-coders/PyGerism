A increase in fighting in Darfur has forced 138,000 people to flee their homes since mid-January and there is almost no solution in sight to the conflict in Sudan's largest region. The U.N. says the security situation in other parts of Darfur remains "fragile" with endless conflicts between local tribes over resources.

There has been many conflicts like this in history, so solving would be a tactic that many people would be able to help with. We should also budget some money to give shelter to those who are being forced out. Doing so could strengthen relations. I dont know enough about Shakespeare to compare.

ISIS extremists captured more than 300 workers at a Cement Factory called Al-Badiyeh Cement Co. located about 30 miles from the Syrian capital. The people whom were captured were put on buses and sent into more rigid ISIS ground. There has been no contact from them since the attack. 



In this situation, we should try to get surveillance in ISISs more firmly grasped areas. We shouldnt do anything rash, such as Nuke the area because there is civilians. But if push come to shove, and if there is almost no hope for them then that might be the only option. I dont know enough about Shakespeare to compare.

Thousands of migrants and refugees are camping out in Piraeus, Greece, a very important tourist site for this country. On Thursday they were given two-weeks to move out to a military-camp or get moved by force. Though still many of them are refusing no matter how much money the government spends on translators to persuade them to leave. Theyve made great progress now only a little over 4,000 migrants and refugees remain.



There is people telling them that there is other sites with better resources and theyre still not leaving completely. Theyve done everything that the military can do, its time for them to move them forcibly. I dont know enough about Shakespeare to compare.
