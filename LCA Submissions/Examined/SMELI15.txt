In Nicosia, Cyprus, their president (Nicos Anastasiades) says that he takes no risk of his country (Greece) being pressured out of the class of countries that use the euro (money) as their currency. President Anastasiades says that on Thursday is the discussion between Greece and their collectors are continuous. Since it's continuous, it would be in nobody's interest for their people (from Greece) to leave the eurozone. Cyprus successfully transpired from their 3 year rescue program that was $10 billion up to $11.36 billion. The rescue program took on a huge hit from Greece's economic misfortunes, because their banking and financial connects to country. Ambassador from European Union institutions and the International Financial Fund are meeting with Greek officials to discuss social security reforms that have triggered strong civil disobedience in the country.



In this article, I believe that the president of Cyprus is making a wise discussion of not letting Greece out of the eurozone, because they have their Rescue Program that is worth over millions of dollars. I see no connection of this article that relates to Shakespeare.

John Kerry (U.S. Secretary of State) won't give an apology for America's atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan during the time of his visits at a honored memorial. At the Peace Memorial Park and Museum, Mr. Kerry is ruling out an confession ahead of Monday's tour with other foreign ministers. In Japan, 140,000 Japanese people died from one of the 2 atomic bombs that have been dropped on Hiroshima by the U.S  ever since the final days of World War  over 70 years ago. Secretary Kerry is expected to lay flow and express the catastrophe that reflects on the first usage of a nuclear weapon against our enemy in the past. The official provided Kerry's plans on condition of invisibility, because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss them before the event.





In this article, I believe that unfair for our secretary doesnt think that it is necessary to owe an apology for the nuclear bombing that destroyed civilization over 70 years ago. I see no connection of this article that relates to Shakespeare.

In Toronto, Canada, Canadian primary community of 2,000 people has announced a state of emergency, because 11 people attempted suicide over the weekend. Christina Lazarova (a spokeswoman for Canada's health minister) said Monday there were 4  suicide attempts Friday and 7 Saturday in the Ontario community of Attawapiskat. She says there were 26 attempts in March and 86 since September. There has been at least one death. Mental health nurses and social workers are being flown in. On Twitter, Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) called the news "heartbreaking" and said that the government will work to improve living conditions for all domestic people. Perry Bellegarde calls an assembly of 1st nations dicusses about the situation is too common in domestic communities and that they need a constant commitment to approach a established issues that lead to hopelessness.

In this article, I find it awful that people would commit their deaths. I think we should find a way to help the people (who attempted to commit suicide) with their issues. I see no connection of this article that relates to Shakespeare.
