# PyScape
This project is to be used by teachers, facilitators, professors, legislators, translators, alogators, and all other "rs"
It takes an input of a list of essays or papers likewise and analyzez them locally against one another. 
All of this is done locally so that no essays could be uploaded to the internet to be stolen and/or sold. This is to protect the students
and ensure that essays are all genuine.
