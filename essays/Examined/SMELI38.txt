Article Title: N. Ireland Woman Who Induced Abortion Given Suspended Prison Term

Date Published: April 5th, 2016

The woman (not legally allowed to be named) was just a regular woman trying to right the mistake she had made. She became pregnant and was searching for a place to abort her unborn child. Unlike the United States, Irelands Abortion clinics were very expensive and therefore the woman did not have enough money to go to the clinic. Fortunately she was able to contact a doctor who specializes in abortions. He gave her advice and special poisons to induce a miscarriage. The poisons worked and the fetus was aborted. The neighbors contacted local Irish authorities once they found the fetus in the trash. Local anti-abortion group, Precious Life, was called to trial and then found the defendant guilty. The woman was sentenced to life in prison after Precious Life gave the quote, Every woman, being with child, who, with intent to procure her own miscarriage shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing ... shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable to be kept in penal servitude for life." The woman is now serving life in prison. 



A woman should be able to do whatever she wants with her body. If she does believes that a child could endanger her life, or become an issue she should not have to life with her bad decision for the rest of her life. I believe that healthcare for women should offer coverage on abortion. In some cases the insurance will cover abortion if the woman is a victim of incest, rape, or if the fetus endangered her life. But in some cases i do believe that women should be able to have access to abortion clinics, no matter what the situation. This can change so many women's lives, and give them more opportunities to live their life. If men do not have to live with the child if they do not want to, why should a women have to raise the child. If we make abortion rates cheaper, and offer it in more countries than I believe we can make a difference in many people's lives.

Women who wear veils because they are Muslim are just like Negros in favor of slavery. Before apologizing, a woman who believes that women should not be covered but should instead be free, caused a lot of problems when she tweeted something about a clothing line featuring Muslim clothing. 





I believe that you should be able to wear whatever you want. If it is because your religion or if you just want to no one should stop you from making that choice. Clothing lines like Dolce and Gabbana are affecting many by expanding their lines to please more people and religious customs. This in no way should affect others like it did the one lady because if you are comfortable that is the only thing that matters.

When Hitler was ruler, he killed over 6 million people, the majority being Jews. Since then our world has come together and overcame this tragedy. People want to close his home in fear that Neo-Nazi men and women would come back to the home. 



      In my opinion, everything that happens and history happens for a reason. If Hitler hadn't of done that our world would be totally different and possibly for worse. I believe that the home should still be open for people to go back and mourn. If other people want to visit the home that is their right. We should not be able to stop people from doing what they believe for our opinion. though I don't agree it is their opinion and they have the right to pursue anything that they want we shouldn't have to close on a home for them to not do what they believe in.
