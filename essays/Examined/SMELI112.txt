A Wars End?

In south sudan rebels and the military are having a peace talk, but the look ready to fight. In the capital city of Sudan  to armies have set up camp, the rebel army consisting of 3,000. This is a risky but necessary step. The rebel army is armed with only assault rifles the army has tanks and other armaments stationed there. The reason you should care is because this could mean the end of the war in Sudan, and many people will be able to return home again.

I think its great that the soldiers in south sudan will get to go home. I also think its good that the rebels will be able to go home safely . I dont know enough shakespeare to say if and how this relates.

Illegal immigrants paying smugglers



Illegal immigrants are paying smugglers large sums of money to transport them across the border. Apparently a large some of people are involved in smuggling people. This affects us because they are being smuggled to place all over the world. 

I think it's terrible that people have to go to such lengths to find a safe place to stay. I dont know enough shakespeare to say if and how this relates.

A slow truce  

A truce has been set up in yemen by the UN between yemen's government and the rebels. Both sides say they will not attack but reserve the right to respond to attacks. There have been several attacks reported from both sides but neither side claims responsibility for. 

I think its a good that a truce is in effect, and that maybe its possible to achieve peace in Yemen. I dont know enough shakespeare for this.
