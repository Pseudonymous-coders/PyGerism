Development of modern Russian foreign policy could be divided into two eras or phases: the post Soviet policy after Michael Gorbachev and the Putin era policy. Both are philosophically and politically different from one another.The post Soviet era policy was based entirely on the Gorbachevian ideology of Perestroika and Glasnost (Restructuring and Openness) in post Communist milieu when new Russias first president Boris Yelstsin put in place a new non-communist foreign policy abandoning the Soviet socialist ideology completely in order to advance the national interest of an essentially first ever anti-communist government in modern Russia.



This is very similar to The Taming of The Shrew This article is talking about two different sides of development. One side is trying to get the West on his side. Sadly, he failed. So the other side swooped in and stole the West. That person now succeeded in getting what the other person couldn't get. This story is very similar to a stereotypical high school setting that we could use for our trailer.

Mr. Yatsenyuk has been in office ever since the former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in February 2014. Petro Poroshenko, the current President, asked him to quit in February saying that he had lost all support. His government was accused of inaction and corruption. Mr. Yatsenyuk has announced on Twitter that on Tuesday, April 12, his request to resign as Prime minister of Ukraine, will be submitted to the Parliament. 



This story would go nicely with our modern re-telling because it sounds like a bullying story. Since we are in this new generation where bullying comes in many forms, we could incorporate this into our story. The current President was starting to give up because he had lost so much support. He did not feel supported as the president so he wanted to give up. It is like that in this world. Friends may not feel supported by their other friends so they give up.

After three days of fighting, Armenia and Azerbaijan have announced a truce after fighting in the secessionist region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Seeing that this fight has flared up, it is proof that the post-soviet conflicts and problems have not been taken care of. At any moment, these problems could be ignited by the realignment of of international alliances and loyalties. If that happens, people will start dying again.



This is very similar to the story of Romeo and Juliet. In the story, the Capulets know that Romeo is a Montague. The father knows that he is a good boy and he doesnt intend to kill him in the beginning. There is basically an alliance with Romeo and Juliets father because her father does not know that Romeo is trying to get Juliet. Since they are different families, there are still some problems that have not been taken care of. One spark could cause a bigger problem between their families. One problem that happened is that Tybalt and Romeo got into a fight and Tybalt ended up dead and Romeo's best friend ended up dead as well. People died because of a spark that ignited the family problems.
