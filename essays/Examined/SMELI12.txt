This week an unnamed german source leaked 2.6 terabytes of confidential documents that shone a light on the corruption of many world leaders and how the used offshore bank accounts to evade taxes and hide money. Many of Chinas top leaders owned Shelf companies that did not do anything except hold money for the leaders. The leaders have tried to hide the corruption that is very prevalent in their system. The now block any website the has the words Panama Papers to hide their corruption. Many reporters tried to contact people in China who had personal relationships with the officials, but all sources refused to comment or answer any questions.

I think that China should stop censoring the internet and let their citizens see the world for themselves and make their own opinions. Our group could use Chinas leaders as the daughters of King Lear, and the president as King Lear.

After the release of the Panama Papers FIFAs corruption came into question yet again. The new leader of the soccer clubs was saying that he would usher in a new era of soccer with no corruption. He raised questions after he sold the TV rights to a different company than he told everyone he would for three times as much. The news is saying that he sold the rights at undervalue the first time. The U.S. is questioning the leader because they thing is taking bribes like the rest of the ethics committee was. The U.S. has arrested other FIFA officials for taking bribes and tax evasion.

I think that we should not have problems with corruption at this day in age. FIFA should not have corruption, because the game of soccer is not important enough to go to jail for life, just for more money and power. We could use with shakespeare as some sort of betrayal moment.

Title: Bernie Sanders Hits Hillary Clinton On 'Panama Papers' Tax Dodging

Bernie Sanders calls out Hillary Clinton for supporting the Panama Free Trade Agreement which allowed for rich people in the U.S. to move their move to tax havens with even less regulation. Sanders strongly opposed the FTA due to opportunity it provided to many americans to move their money to tax havens, while Hillary supported. Her name is not mentioned anywhere is the papers, but Bernie thinks that she could have done something to mitigate the effects. Bernie said that anyone who supported things that allow for tax evasion and other heinous crimes should be president. He pledged to repeal the agreement within six months of his becoming president.

I agree with Sanders because anything that can be done to close tax loopholes should be done, because otherwise the U.S. will rely on taxes from the middle class instead of the rich. We could use this with shakespeare by having him be one of the people macbeth kills or him being an activist that opposes him.
