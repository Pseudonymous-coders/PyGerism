Region: North America 

Summary: Josiah Utu, his mother, and older brother all died last thursday. His older brother stabbed josiah and his mother several times and then himself they all died except for the older brother. He later died in the hospital. The brother had two massive concussions from sports and family and friends said that hes never been the same since. 



I think that this shows us that we need to take care of family members and if we think some arent okay we need to help them get better. By helping family members were not only protecting ourselves but were protecting everyone else around us. We would also be saving lives if we take care of family members who are sick and need some help.

Summary: Sandy Hook was the shooting at a elementary school a while ago, and that affected a ton of people and families. obama sat down and talked about how that was hard to go through. He also talked about how he struggled to cope with everything that was happening. 



I think that when this all happened and he made a speech about it on the news that he did really well with handling it. I think that he was really supportive to the friends and family. I think that everything he did to help them get through it all was amazing and that he did really well handling it.

Summary: Georgia prepares to execute Kenneth Fults despite his racist unfair. In an article people talk about his trial and all the pasts things hes done and they talk about how other people have done same things but they didnt get killed and people are saying that theyre just being racist about it. 



I think that depending on how severe the stuff he did was then he should be put in jail for an amount of years. I dont think that any one should be killed no matter what they did. I think that everyone should have a chance to change in jail and take that time.
