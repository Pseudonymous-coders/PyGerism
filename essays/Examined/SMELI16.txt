A remote Canadian Aboriginal community of 2,000 people has declared a suicide emergency after 11 people attempted suicide. 4 people attempted on friday and 7 on saturday. Prime minister Justin Trudeau declared on twitter the news heartbreaking, and said the government will work to improve the living conditions for all indigenous people.  Assembly of First Nations chief Perry Bellegarde said the situation is too common in indigenous communities and they need to address issues that lead to hopelessness. A resident of Attawapiskat said her 13-year-old great niece took her own life because of school bullying and health problems. Trudeau has promised to improve the conditions of the all indigenous people. 



School bullying and suicides have correlated for a very long time. As school bullying becomes worse so does the chance of suicides increase. The fact that a country problems with their own people is very upsetting. However the fact that the government will use their resources to help their people is amazing. As of now I can see no connection to shakespeare.

A Turkish official says ties with Israel rests on reaching an agreement over aid to the Gaza Strip. A spokesman For the Turkish President said the negotiations are continuing but we are not at a place where we can say an agreement has been created. He also said there will be a few more meetings In the coming weeks. Israel and Turkey were close allies but ties broke down in 2010 because of commandos storming a turkish aid ship. 



Personally all I can say is if negotiations to come soon people in the Gaza Strip will be greatly affected by this decision. Looking at this now I cant really see a connection to shakespeare.

Article:Child Bombers Used by Boko Haram Increases 10-Fold, UNICEF Says

The number of child bombers used by Islamic Terrorists have increased from 4 to 44 in a year. 75% percent of the children used are girls. As suicide attacks increase with children some communities are starting to see children as threats. However these thoughts can have a destructive consequence. How can a community rebuild itself when its casting out its own brother and sisters? One case had a woman who was freed from the extremists went back to her family and told the mother she was trained to be a suicide bomber. The mother feared her own daughter and turned her into the military. Boko Haram the terrorist group has used the common desires of youth. They have given loans to youth to help Boko Haram economically.



With the number of child bombers increasing I wonder how Boko Haram gets the children. The fact that Boko Haram may be Stealing children from their families is horrible. The country needs to do something about Boko Haram and return all the children to their families if possible. I can regrettably see no relation to shakespeare.
