There has been almost 100 deaths in the southern parts of India from having one of the hottest days ever recorded in April, temperatures reached 48.8C (119.84F) on Monday. The heatwave is covering most of northern india and is now reaching temperatures of 40C (104F) in 3 days in a row. Life threatening temperatures is now becoming more normal and is coming earlier than usual as well as staying longer. Wind from the west normally keeps area cool with nice winds from the sea of Bengal but because of the extreme temperatures the wind is now super hot and making it fatal for the land and the people living there. Many parts of asia are dry and baked from high temperatures and a poor monsoon season in 2015. Monsoon season is time of seasonal winds and precipitation or rain. Some areas receive half of the normal amount of rain and the ground which is super dry reflects and causes the air to become even hotter. Only relief from the heat comes from monsoon season and it doesn't normally come until mid-June. Last year there was a similar heat wave that swept through and had killed an estimated 2000 people. The disaster management officials estimated the death toll may reach 100 by the beginning of the week. 



I find it sad that with current technologies and architecture in some countries, huge countries still suffer to something we don't think about as being as life threatening yet people in india have to constantly hope not to fall to something like weather. This could also open our eyes to the issue of global warming. The records for highest temperature are always being broken because the world is slowly getting getting warmer and warmer.

Recently a couple of taliban fighters were approached by Isis and offered superior weapons and little choice but to accept. The taliban leader of their faction pledged allegiance to Isis while on a trip to pakistan. They quickly realized that Isiss true agenda wasnt to help ordinary afghans. They just like beheading said one of the former fighters, "They knew who was rich to take their money, and the poor they would arm to fight with them, or kill them the other added. There were many stories of how they would kill to kill and do very unislamic things like leave the bodies unburied after killing. They quickly realized that this new friendship was a mistake and needed to leave. They said the worst part was learning that if you dies while serving them then your family wouldn't be given to your relatives but placed into a camp. They two men were happy when drones would fly over their village because they would target and kill Isis members as they step out of their houses. They also stated that the government has made no progress and the only thing that seems to be effective is bombing. Isis members would kill anyone they caught and burn down their houses. They burned down my house too. One time they made me kneel on explosives and give a speech before being blown up, the video was posted to facebook for the world to see.



It's sickening to hear about these conditions people have to live through. They don't have a choice but to comply or be beheaded for the entire world to see. I believe that we are trying to contain it with constant airstrikes and drone attacks but stuff like this still happens all the time. This does not relate to shakespeare.

Topic: Chinas attempt to cut down in terrorism promotions

Article: China tech companies pledge to tackle content that promotes terrorism

Twenty five Chinese technology companies have agreed to attack pictures and information that supports or promotes terrorism. The Cyberspace Administration of China said the companies had promised to handle in a timely way terror-related harmful, illegal information, create a clear internet space and maintain social stability. The regulator said that more than 25,000 posts, 4,000 videos and 200 accounts had been removed from the internet so far this year that involve illegal, terror-related content. China also passed an anti-terrorism law in december that requires technology firms to help decrypt information and cooperate with the government in fighting terrorism. Critics say China uses its counter-terror and national security regulations to silence free speech. China defends the law saying it does what western nations already do in asking technology firms to help fight terror. The law has caused unease in the western capitals. China says it faces a serious threat from groups such as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which works in Chinas western region of Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, where hundreds have died of violence in recent years. Rights groups and many foreign experts though say China has never presented any convincing evidence to prove ETIM exists as a well-organised group capable of the kinds of attacks China blames it for.



It's good to see that China is doing something to fight against terrorism. Although i can see why law is controversial in the sense of weakening securities and protection in order to be able to control accounts. Theyre setting an example and hopefully people will follow in the fight against terrorism. This does not relate to shakespeare.
