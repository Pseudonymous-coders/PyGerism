Article: Greece sends first migrants back to Turkey under new EU deal

The EU has made a new deal with Turkey to help with the migrant crisis happening in Europe. Many Syrians, Afghans, and others from middle eastern countries, have been migrating through Turkey and crossing the border illegally into Greece. The EU is to send back all of the migrants who crossed the border illegally after april 20th, and in exchange, the Turkish government will send over the same number of vetted Syrian refugees to be relocated in Europe. The maximum amount of syrian refugees the EU will allow back into Europe is 72,000. The EU is also going to give Turkey billions in funding to help provide for the migrants theyre sending back. The first boat deported on April 4th, from Greece, was carrying about 202 people. None of the passengers on board applied for asylum. Some protesters are against the new policy set in place by the EU. They feel like the refugees shouldnt be sent back to Turkey. They believe it is becoming very unsafe for the refugees, since there's rumors that the Turkish people have low tolerance towards refugees and the Turkish government is forcibly sending the refugees back to Syria.

I believe that the deal should be revoked, If all of these rumors about Turkey are true. The refugees are just trying to escape war and find safety, most of them dont mean any harm. But closing europes borders does have an advantage at helping to stop terrorist from being able to cross over the border easily. I dont really think that this would go with any of the shakespearian plays we were given, but then again I dont think I know enough about the plays to be able to place an article with them.

Article: paris terror suspect Mohamed Abrini arrested in Belgium

The most wanted terrorist in Europe has recently been arrested. His name is Mohamed Abrini. He has been linked to the paris attack last November, and is suspected to have played a part in the Belgian attack that has happened recently. They can positively link him to the Paris attack through surveillance, which shows him driving the same car used in the paris attacks and him driving another terrorist linked to the attack. There is also DNA linking him to the Paris attack. With the Belgian attack, there is video of what they think is Abrini in disguise rolling the luggage cart with the explosives along with two other men. Another man was arrest, Osama Krayem or Naim al Hamed. He is for a fact, thanks to his many post of Facebook, affiliated to ISIS. He is believed to be apart of the Brussels bombing. 4 of the 6 people that they know were involved in the brussels attack and Paris were killed and the other 2 are arrested. This is a step forward for Europe to solve these terrorist attacks and to bring justice to the many people who lost their lives and loved ones.

I think that this is awesome. All of the people who died and the families and friends that were affected need closure, and hopefully this helps bring them that. This is also one step closer to stopping ISIS, and to bring more peace back onto this planet that desperately needs it. I hope that the terrorist responsible for these acts get to rot in a jail cell for the rest of their pitiful lives, so they can realize what pathetic losers they are. I feel like this article will go great with Macbeth.

The Prime Minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, is defending Belgiums government and the nation's security after being under heavy scrutiny by other countries following the Brussels attack. He is making sure that other countries know that Belgium is doing all they can. He is comparing this event to 9/11, saying that his country is going to learn from the mistakes from this event to better the future. The Interior Minister, Jan Jambon, offered to resign after realizing the missed opportunities to stop terrorist, Ibrahim El Bakraoui, but Michel rejected the offer. Turkey was the one to catch Ibrahim El Bakraoui and put him on a plane that took him to Netherlands. The Turkish President decided to critique Belgium's government, which resulted in Michel coming back and critiquing how they handled Ibrahim El Bakraoui. Even after Michel tried to stop the Scrutiny happening, people are pointing thing out that are wrong with the countries. The are divided into the north and south, and starting in june 2010, the country went 589 days without a government, because they were being stubborn and couldnt make a decision on who should be elected. On top of that, Belgium has the most terrorist going to fight for extremist groups in the middle east. They have about 500 people that have gone to join.

I think that people need to stop critiquing the Belgian government. They could have done a better job dealing with the terrorist, but the thing is they are a victim of an attack. Right now, we should be helping them with counterterrorism and helping them improve and just give them moral support. I think that this would be good for King Lear.
