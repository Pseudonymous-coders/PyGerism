Article: Why Mexicans are troubled by Donald Trump

Source: BBC News

Chumel torres is a Mexican comedian that has his spanish channel channel on youtube where he has made donald trump jokes. He has grown tired of making them since they're the same thing and wants fresh things. Talking about Donald Trump it has become a worrying matter for many mexicans. It has become concerning for them because a lot of the Mexican families rely on remittances from their families who are in The US. It has become concerning and worrying to families in mexico because if Donald trump ends up winning he will deport all Mexicans back to mexico and they will not be able to sustain themselves since they rely on remittances from their family members whom are in the US. Dona irlanda states that it is hard finding a job that will pay good. The things that Donald trump has said about Mexicans has infuriated many people one of them being Vicente Fox who has said that Donald trump is a danger to the world. Reason to why is because of the crazy ideas he has said like Building a wall between the US and Mexico to keep out mexicans.

This is a worrying matter for many Mexicans because they won't be able to support themselves if they all get sent back to Mexico. From my knowledge of Mexico its really hard getting paid well over there and they come over here for a better chance in life and to be able to support their families who are back in mexico. If they cant do that and get deported back to mexico its going to affect not only the adults but their children. Hispanic students will be affected by having their parents be deported, they wouldn't know if they'd get deported as well or if they would become orphans. This is a serious and scary matter for those who have hispanic families. I don't know how i can relate this to Shakespeare.

Article:Venezuela arrests Interpol detective over cocaine haul

Source: BBC News

Eliecer Garcia Torrealba, Interlope Chief detective in venezuela was arrested for letting a plane with 349 kg of cocaine go to the Dominican Republic. He is being accused of using his post to ship cocaine to other places and there are 16 people being held for having a connection to shipment of cocaine. They also have suspicion of Pablo Cardenas being the one being the whole shipment of cocaine. The United states has been accusing venezuela officials of not doing enough to stop the smuggling and production of cocaine to other places like south africa.



This is a big deal because even the police in venezuela cant be trusted enough. A lot of high ranking members of the military have been involved with smuggling cocaine. How is smuggling illegal drugs going to stop if the cops themselves allow for it to happen? There needs to be something that will make sure that the police is trustable because it is involving a lot of the people on the police and military force. I don't know how i can relate this to Shakespeare.

Birubala Rabha has a campaign to stop branding women as witches.  She has had a mistrust in the quacks since she took her son to see one and now she can prove it with this campaign. The victims that have been accused of being witches were abused or thrown out of their town. Some of the victims have been thrown out for saying no to sexual offers, others because the quacks business was getting ruined by their husbands business and some victims were branded witches so they could own the land. Most of the victims accused of being witches are women.Single women, old and windows were targeted for being witches. There has been witch hunters in india since 2000 and Birubala Rabha has started a campaign to stop witch hunters and invoked the law to stop the abuse of those so called witch hunters. She believes that it is unfair for quacks to be branding woman just to get what they want and that they are frauds.

This is a serious matter in india because they are abusing women of being witches for their selfish needs. There has been many grisly attacks towards these victims because of it and it is important that somebody is doing something to stop these attacks and to help out the victims that have been thrown out or abused. Witch Hunting needs to be stopped in india because it is unfair for women to get abused just because they want their land or the victims have refused their sexual offers.  I don't know how i can relate this to Shakespeare.
