A group of kids are attempting to sue president Obama for ruining the environment for future generations. These kids range from ages 8-19 and have just achieved a major accomplishment in getting the case approved by Judge Thomas Coffin.The case was attempted to be dismissed by the government and fossil fuel companies but was dismissed shortly after. The kids want the world to eliminate the use of fossil fuels by the year 2050 so the future generations won't have to go through the effects of global warming. The intent on suing the president is to push the government into creating a full out plan to eliminate the problem of global warming.



Personally I think that some of these kids are looking for publicity. How at the age of eight are you able to comprehend the actual severity of global warming and the actual effects it has on the world. The moral is a good one but the act itself on suing the president give these children a rebellious look to them.

The zika virus is scaring many people in north america because of the birth defects and other affects the virus has on the human body. It is transported by mosquitoes and is more dangerous than first expected.The cure for zika is being funded by the leftover donations from the ebola relief funds.The cdc has warned the rest of the world about this virus and gave puerto rico 3.9 million in emergency relief funds. The virus has been spread to dallas texas and is transmitted through sexual contact not a mosquito bite.



In my opinion i think that this virus scare will go away within a couple months or even weeks.The ebola scare was made to be the scariest illness of our time because of it popularity online.  This lead to more funding for a cure and eventually putting the popularity of this virus at bay.

Bernie Sanders made a public statement saying that he would change the laws made in some states discriminating the LGBT community.He said that our country has come to far to have still have this discrimination to exist. He is calling out the governor of mississippi and North carolina for signing laws that discriminate against LGBT members.Bernie Sanders responded saying that  You have your political views. That's fine,'" Sanders added. "But I hope we remember what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told us. You judge people on their character, not on the color of their skin. And I would add to that not on their gender or sexual orientation."



I Personally support Sanders for this act even when I don't believe in other acts that he has promised to do. I feel like this is not only the right thing to do, but also common sense. American is basically a synonym to freedom and freedom is supposed to come to all.
