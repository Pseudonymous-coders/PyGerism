Article Title:Turkey president wants to strip 'terror supporters' of citizenship

Date the article was published:4/5/16

Article Source:BBC News



Summary Paragraph:



Turkey is trying to revoke or get rid of the citizenship of people who are connected to terrorists. That basically says that people will be kicked out of the country if they support terrorists. This is supported because the article says that if they want to destroy the country then they can leave the country.



We should be worried about this because the people that are denied citizenship in Turkey have to go somewhere and one of those places may possibly be the United States. I do not have knowledge of Shakespeare at this time.

`The European Commission, the part of the EU responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding treaties and managing the day-to-day business, has come up with other ways for   efficient and sympathetic way of handling the housing in the movement of people.



This matters because people should always be concerned about how people who are taking the initiative to try and change their environment are treated in general. I do not have knowledge of Shakespeare at this time.

Article Title:Macedonia Parliament to Be Dissolved Ahead of Early Election



Date Published:4/6/16

Source: ABC News



Summary Paragraph:

A Parliament is a type of government where the most powerful group of people are in control of the government. Macedonia is located above Greece. Macedonia is planning on changing their government as a result of a wire-tapping scandal. That basically means that information was recorded that should have been kept secret and was possibly shared with the wrong people.



We should all worry about this because when the parliament collapses we we not know which type of government will take its place. It could range from democratic or communist. And that could possibly affect who they side with in wars or debates. I do not have knowledge of Shakespeare at this time.
