Article: Syria war: IS group killed 21 Christians in al-Qaryatain

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36011663?intlink_from_url=http://www.bbc.com/news/topics/45d1e6e1-6001-4449-801d-ba85eed04025/syrian-civil-war&link_location=live-reporting-story 

Reports are emerging of the killing of Syrian Christians by Islamic State militants in the town of al-Qaryatain.

The town was retaken by these Syrian forces who had russia on their backs and their allies earlier in the week.

Some 21 Christians were murdered when almost 300 Christians remained in the city after IS captured it last August, said the head of the Syrian Orthodox Church.

Five more Christians are still missing, believed dead. Negotiations and the payment of ransoms have seen the remainder of the group re-join their families.

IS setbacks Coaches laid on by the Syrian government have been bringing thousands of residents back to al-Qaryatain and the nearby city of Palmyra.

IS captured al-Qaryatain in August, and abducted hundreds of residents,including dozens of Christians, many of whom were were ransomed by their families.

Al-Qaryatain, about 100km west of Palmyra, was taken over by IS fighters in their first major offensive since they seized Palmyra last May. There has been a dramatic drop in fighting in Syria since a partial ceasefire came into effect last month, though IS and the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front were excluded and are still being targeted.



I am not familiar enough on shakespeare poetry and plays to tell if this story relates. I believe that the IS group should be monitored more on their terroristic actions and attacks throughout the future. I also think that the people investigating this scene should investigate further into what the reasoning behind this murder was.

Article: Lebanon car bombing kills Palestinian Fatah official

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36024247 



A local Palestinian official has been killed in a car bomb explosion near the south Lebanese port city of Sidon, Lebanese security officials say. 

Fathi Zeidan, nicknamed "Zorro", was the Fatah movement's security chief in the Mieh Mieh Palestinian refugee camp. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which occurred in nearby Ein el-Hilweh camp. However, Fatah gunmen have recently been involved in clashes with rival factions in Ein el-Hillweh. One man was killed earlier this month when one dispute escalated. Lebanese security officials say the bomb that killed Mr Zeidan was placed inside his car and he would have died instantly. About 450,000 Palestinians are registered with the UN as refugees in Lebanon, and most live in 12 official camps that mainly fall outside the jurisdiction of the Lebanese security services.

I believe that there should have been immediate claim of responsibility for the blast after it occurred. I also think that the security guard couldve been on tighter lock down.

Article: Iraq: UN fears hunger in besieged Iraqi city of Falluja

Food shortages faced by 60,000 civilians in the besieged Iraqi city of Falluja are extremely worrying and are likely to get worse, the UN has warned. The World Food Programme says that food prices remain too high, while stocks are dwindling in shops and homes. Government forces trying to recapture the city from so-called Islamic State militants have cut supply routes, and IS is stopping people from leaving. "In March, the price of wheat was six times more expensive than in December."Furthermore, shops and markets have run out of food supplies including wheat,sugar, rice, vegetable oil and lentils, says the report, that was conducted by a mobile phone survey last month. Reaching respondents has become increasingly hard because of poor mobile phone signals in the city and the fear of reprisals. "Aid has not reached Falluja since the government recaptured nearby Ramadi in December 2015, with supply routes cut off by Iraqi forces and the armed groups preventing civilians from leaving," the report says. It quotes sources as saying that residents in the city have to endure both"Vicious IS rule and a constant fear of being killed by shells launched into the city by Iraqi military forces".

I believe that the UN should take action in helping the besieged city of Falluja. I also think that the iraqi forces shouldnt cut of supply roots so that armed groups can prevent civilians from leaving.
