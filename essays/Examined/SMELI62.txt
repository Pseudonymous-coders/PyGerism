Article title:  Afghanistan earthquake shakes major cities

A 6.6 magnitude earthquake has just struck Afghanistan, causing a numerous amount of cities across Southwest Asia to be affected. A similar earthquake struck Afghanistan just last October and severe damages were made. It is still unknown how many citizens were injured or even possibly killed, but according to reports, at least 30 people have been injured. Many major cities were forced to stop what they were doing because of the earthquake. Houses, subways and buildings have been destroyed with even more danger to come. Because the earthquake had to hit right on the Hindu Kush mountains, fatal landslides might occur soon. This event is very important to people all around the world because deaths, accidents and danger lie ahead for the people in South-west Asia. Due to this tragedy, any trade, work or activities will be stopped for a few days and a reconstruction period might take place in the areas that were affected by the earthquake.



The earthquake that recently just happened in Afghanistan is a huge tragedy for the citizens and things like this are just unavoidable. I feel like natural disasters just make everyone question the world more and that's exactly what shakespeare needs to make his plays even more tempting to read. I think having a natural disaster like the Afghanistan earthquake could be incorporated into shakespeares play  The Tempest. In the beginning of the play, the characters get into a  shipwreck due to a terrible storm. Nowadays not too many of those happen since we have modern modes of transportation, so having a different disaster occur like an earthquake in  The Tempest would remodel the play into a more modern and realistic version of a classic.

Article title:East Asia faces growth slowdown, World Bank warns

East Asia has had a tremendous amount of economic growth within the past 10 years. It is shocking how fast they have developed and even more shocking that their economy growth is beginning to slow down. According to many reporters and analyst, East Asias Gross Domestic Product (GDP) percentage will slowly decline from 6.5 to 6.2 % by the year of 2017-2018. For us this may not look like a huge drop, but for places like China, this is a massive problem in their economy. Businesses have been booming almost faster than the rate at which bacteria grow and now, areas like China will be taking a toll on their economy that will affect EVERYONE. Big buck companies in places like China will have to take a long recovery, since business will be declining very shortly due to the faster-than-expected slowdown. This decline in East Asias economic growth will impact stocks and trade all over the world.



I have very neutral opinions towards Asias slowly declining economy. On one hand, it's great for America, but on the other hand it's not great for my people back in China. Personally, I feel like China is pretty close to America economy wise and I don't think it should be a big issue if they are going back to steady increases in GDP rather than rapid increases. I think this phase in economy  East Asia is going through could be related into Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. I think that using two big powerhouse companies, one from East Asia and one from the United States, could possibly divide the montagues and the capulets even more since East Asia and the U.S are very competitive when it comes to economy.

Topic: Muslim marriage rules

Article title: Triple talaq: India's Muslim women fight against instant divorce

Published:  4/10/16

The triple talaq is quickly become a huge issue with Muslim women in India today. The triple talaq is a method for men to quickly divorce their wives in an instant. Some Muslim men send their wives a message while others end the relationship on telephone. Muslim women in India no longer wanted to put up with this nonsense so they took this to the supreme court. Women told the government that the triple talaq was unfair and outdated. Nowhere in the Quran did it say that men were allowed to treat women this way. The triple talaq has affected the lives of many Muslim women in India in negative ways. Some have been forced to go back to their poor families, while others suffer not knowing where their future may lie ahead. This issue has been growing throughout the years and is now bigger than ever. It is important that everyone in the world is treated equally and things like the triple talaq interfere with this. Women no longer want to be the underdogs and it is important that the world knows and accepts this.



I strongly disagree with the triple talaq methods that have been going on in Muslim culture for years. This inhumane rule has been banned from everywhere except for India and I think it's time to put it to a stop once and for all. I think the triple talaq method could be incorporated into shakespeares Romeo and Juliet, since it resembles unfairness in marriages as shown throughout the play itself. The triple talaq would enhance the struggles of marriages and divorces in the play which would make it even more interesting.
