Article: US to transfer a dozen Guantanamo inmates to other countries soon

91 Prisoners are being held at Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo Bay is a prison in Cuba and holds a lot of muderers and terrorists. Barack Obama wants to let them be released into different countries, and some will be going to maximum security prisons in the U.S. He will release a little at a time and soon there will be no one being held there. Obama thinks that the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay are not being treated correctly. They are going on hunger strikes so they dont have to be in there anymore. 





I believe that the people who are in Guantanamo Bay should stay there. That prison is one of the harshest and you only go there if you have done bombing and mass murders. I think they should be treated like any other prison but they should stay away from our country and others so we can keep people safe. I can not see how this relates to my shakespear play.

Article: Donald Trump advocates 'punishment' for women who have abortions - but retracts hours later

Donald Trump does not want abortions to be happening in the United States, but went too far when stating it. He said that women who defy the law when he becomes president should be punished some way. He said this in an inerview on MSNBC and reversed his thought two hours later stating that the doctors should be punished not the women.





I dont think it is right for people to have an abortion. There are plenty of ways of preventing pregnancy and they are sold all over the place. If you make a mistake dont punish the kid. Trump is pro-life but should not have brought up any sort of punishment. I think abortions should not be legal but there should not be a punishment if you have one.  I can not see how this relates to my shakespear play.

Article:FBI finds method to hack gunman's iPhone without Apple's help

The FBI hacked an apple iphone that was owned by a gunman. They hacked it without any help from Apple. This means that they can hack into anyones phone. If they did it to one all of the others opperate the same and use the same technology. 



If they can hack an iphone then they can get anyones information and see who they know and who they talk to often. I dont want the FBI looking through my personal information and i dont think anyone does. I can not see how this relates to my shakespear play, because there is nothing to hack in my play.
