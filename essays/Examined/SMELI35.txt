Summary: During the 2016 presidential primary, Republican candidate Donald Trump has become notorious for his comments against Latin Americans, claiming that as president he would attempt to build a gigantic wall along the US-Mexico border to block out illegal immigrants. However in an ironic twist, Trumps threats have actually caused a spike in immigration to the US--both illegally and legally--from Mexico and other countries. Many new immigrants are fearful that escaping their country will become harder with the addition of a wall, so now many are escaping to the US while they still can. This increased rate of immigrants has caused the addition of many immigrant sanctuaries in cities along the border, affecting business in these cities. In my opinion, I find the recent spike quite humorous, and its relation to Shakespeare is pretty clear: people doing things that is in opposite of what the main belligerent wants them to do: Trump wanted less immigrants to come in with his wall, but is instead causing more. In a play like Romeo and Juliet, Friar Lawrence initially intended for Juliet to fake her death so that she could run away with Romeo without her family getting in the way, but instead caused the deaths of both when the plan went wrong.

Summary: A region of Canada is now in a state of emergency when 11 people in the same town committed suicide. The town and region itself is in a very bad state of poverty and ruin, and is a cult-like First Nation establishment that if off-the-grid. The region's leaders are in panic over this new happening and are panicking about what to do in a time like this. The suicides might have all only happened once, the town has had a history with suicide and it will only continue to affect more and more people. 

I am saddened by this loss of people in Canada. Suicide is a very prevalent trait in Shakespeares plays like Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, King Lear, etc., and using stories like these could make modernizing a story of his more realistic and in line with whats happening now.

Summary: A governor from Virginia has recently stated that he will not support a bill that would allow prisoners with the death penalty to be executed by electric-chair if lethal injection was not available, saying that doing so would not be a step in the right direction in terms of how Virginia is now in a more civilized age and that nobody should ever have to face the grueling torture that comes with electric-chair before death. This slight controversy has gotten peoples attentions throughout the country, questioning whether they should or should not do to the same thing that Virginias legislature has wanted to do. This debate has gone on for a while, and if many decide that the electric chair should be used again, this could affect criminals everywhere in their decision to commit crimes as well as those who have been sentenced to death.

Despite how grueling the process is, I think electric chair should be used if it would cause less crimes to be committed. If criminals are afraid to do wrong because of the possibility of being executed by electric chair, then they would not try to commit crimes as often. In Shakespeare death is a very important topic, as well as crime and execution, and figuring out how that is used nowadays makes it easier to incorporate it into our project.
