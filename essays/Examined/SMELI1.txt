A british doctor, Mark Bonar, has been accused of doping over 150 premier athletes throughout 6 different sports including football, tennis, tour de france cyclists, cricket, bodybuilders, and boxers. On Twitter, Bonar has been denying all allegations made against him saying things like The allegations are false and very misleading, I have never had a relationship with any premier football club or player." However the news network investigating the story did not buy it. Instead they followed up their story by launching a private investigation which included secret interviews with secret cameras. During those undercover interviews Bonar admitted that in fact he had been providing premier sports players with performance enhancing drugs. The investigation continued, but the investigators were unable to find any traces of any high profile athletes getting any kind of treatment from Dr. Mark Bonar. Even later in the investigation, research showed that during the time of the scandals Mark Bonar was not even permitted to be practicing medicine in the UK, meaning he does not hold a license. That is because the GMC revoked his license to practice medicine in the UK long ago. Apparently the UKAD, United Kingdom Anti-dope organization, had begun investigating in April 2013, after an interview with an athlete who had also interviewed with the news network currently investigating the scandal. However nobody has brought light to the scandal until very recently. 



As hard as the UKAD, news networks, social media, television, and even civilians work I think it will be very difficult to put a complete end to this ongoing problem. I believe that Dr. Mark Bonar is not the only one in the UK tangled up in this scandal and business. He is just one of the many who have been caught. This problem effects and upsets so many people in the world today because sports have become so popular and such a huge part of todays culture. People like Dr. Bonar have made sports into a mere lie to the rest of the world. I think that this kind of story would work as a shakespearian tragedy because premier athletes are seen as noble people or role-models and by doing this they fall down to a lower level by using performing enhancing drugs and lying to the world.

A nineteen year old girl who lives in Northern Ireland wanted to have an abortion for her 3-month-old unborn baby boy. Northern Ireland is known for being very religious and strictly catholic. Therefore, it was unacceptable for her to have a safe and legal abortion in this community, besides the fact that she did not have nearly enough money to afford traveling to England to have it done there. Instead she contacted an abortion clinic in England which pointed her in the direction of two drugs that would induce an abortion and that are easily available online. Of course, she bought the drugs and soon after her baby boy was aborted. Later her roommates found the three month fetus in their kitchen garbage bin and immediately notified the police. She found herself in a courtroom in Northern Ireland and pleaded guilty towards two charges. She received a three-month suspended prison term. This has flared the abortion controversies world wide. An anti-abortion organization, Precious Life, called for an appeal of the sentence.  The director of the organization, Bernadette Smyth, said the judge had overlooked an 1861 law calling for a life sentence in cases like this. The law states, Every woman, being with child, who, with intent to procure her own miscarriage shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing ... shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable to be kept in penal servitude for life." Everybody was very surprised by the judges lenient sentence.



I think that this girl was stuck in a tough situation at a tough time and in a tough place. If I were in her situation in Northern Ireland, Im not sure what I wouldve done especially because having an abortion in a place like that is frowned-upon in the entire community. It wouldve felt like I couldnt do it not only because its not acceptable, but also because everything and everyone around me would be against it. I dont think I would have done what she did, but I dont know what else I wouldve done. I dont have enough information about shakespeare at this time to know if there is any connection to this story.

On an Italian television show, RAI, Giuseppe Salvatore Riina, the son of one of the countrys most famous mafia bosses, appeared to give an interview promoting a book dedicated to his very own father, Toto Riina.  During the interview Giuseppe Salvatore did not criticize his father even though he was thought to have ordered over one-hundred-fifty deaths by murder while he was boss of Sicilys Cosa Nostra. Younger Riina, being a convicted mobster as well, claimed to have had a happy childhood. He called his father an upstanding man who respects family and traditional values. He even refused to acknowledge the mafias existence at all describing it like everything and nothing at all. Italian politicians and mafia crime victims were angered by the interview conducted by popular talk-show host Bruno Vespa. People started to react openly on social media and posting their thought about the interview some people said they felt sick from watching it and it was also called a reopening of wounds Talk-show host, Bruno Vespa, tried to defend the interview claiming it was valuable insight of the inside of the mafia world and into life of the family in a mafia. Toto Riina was arrested in 1993 and today, is still in jail after being convicted for several murders.



Even though it may have made a good story and the book needed promoting, mafias are always a tough topic especially for the victims and families of victims. I believe the television talk-show and network could have been smarter and more thoughtful keeping in mind that lots of viewers could potentially feel targeted or hurt. This could definitely tie into shakespeare concerning the strong attachments to family. In the interview younger Riina talked about the way his father used to be, he did not mention any violence, dramatic events, or negative attachments. He believed family was very important and family traditions as well.
