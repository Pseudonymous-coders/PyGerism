In Tanzania the once albino sanctuary is no more because in the country tanzania Albinos are being slaughtered like animals. Albino people are people who lack pigment in their skin so they look lighter than normal, they are killed because people make potions out of their body parts because they are said to give good luck and wealth. Over seventy albinos have been killed in the last three years in tanzania, while there have been only ten convictions for murder campaigners say. In the country of tanzania a poor man offered as much as ten thousand dollars for a human body part.The police say they try their best to investigate attacks. "These cases are complicated because most incidents happen in very remote areas where there is no electricity, for example, and that makes identifying perpetrators at night very hard," says Mwanza police commander Valentino Mlowola.

In the most recent case, in May, a woman was hacked to death."We're being killed like animals. Please pray for us," one albino woman sings, at an event called to promote the rights of albinos. May is among 70 people with albinism who live in the remote island of Ukerewe, which is three hours away from Mwanza, the second largest city in Tanzania. "We would urge the government to do more in educating the community here," Mr Namigambo tells me."The government once held seminars about albinism. It made a lot of difference, but not any more," he adds.
