The Democracy Spring states that the campaigns goal is to demand a Congress that will take immediate action to end the corruption of big money in our politics and ensure free and fair elections in which every American has an equal voice. so, their proposals are the support of the Government by the People Act & Fair Elections Now Act, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 & Voter Empowerment Act of 2015; and the Democracy for All Amendment.
3,600 people have pledged to take part in this act of civic disobedience, though a final number has yet to be confirmed. Police were quickly called to the scene, and they began arresting people not even an hour after the protest begun.

The idea that I have is that big money is controlling the news. They show people what they want them to see. It controls the minds of the people. In this sense, people with large amounts of money such as big corporations can pay the media to show what they want. Our country runs on fear at the moment. The people that benefit from that are gun salesman, the government, and security systems.

A evil hail storm destroyed parts of Texas on Monday, causing serious damage to homes and businesses, and now the same storm system is sweeping through the Gulf. This has affected over 1,000 people on our hemisphere. Due to this there is a wave of migrant workers who are showing up to fix the millions of dollars of repairs due to the storms. This is a major hardship for the people in the south.

In my opinion this is a good thing because it will drive our economy through the roof. With all of these people spending money on things rather than  wasting it in a cabinet somewhere. This will help us in the long run so that we can spend the money made in out of country seller's. Otherwise we would have no reason to  have it.

Basically what is happening to the coral is that it dies off and algae grows on top which produces harmful chemicals when it goes through its so called bleaching cycle in where  in this case, the reliance of coral on algae  is part of what makes ecosystems so vulnerable. These responses are fairly hard to predict I would think, but suggest that ecosystems are far more sensitive to climate change than climate models can actually predict, he noted. In other words we are in for a lot of unpleasant surprises.



I agree with the fact that Climate science reports have become so untrustworthy and so predictably false, that none can be accepted as real. After years of crying WOLF and exaggerating predictions. We now have no way of accepting any reportOutrageous stories about toxic algae blooms, (the blob) mass extinctions, unfrozen methane geysers and the ridiculous sea level exaggerations reveal the neo-scientists and faux journalists to be grafters and extortionists.
