Topic: Venezuela Orders Long Weekends to Stave Off Power Crisis

Venezuela workers are given longer weekends to reduce power consumptions because their main income of electricity comes from hydropower (about 70%). Pres. Nicolas Maduro has signed a decree last night (Wednesday) to give state workers Friday furloughs (over the next two months) so the power consumption can decrease by  20%. Officials warnings have said, for weeks, that the water level behind the nation's largest dam has fallen to near its minimum operating level. The Presidents (socialist) administration blames it on a drought, and repeated actions of nearby countries/opponents.

In my opinion, this can be a good thing and a bad thing in some ways. The good things are that the government is trying to preserve their water sources so that they can live, and the workers can also spend some more time with their families if they wanted too. The bad things are that since the government is cutting workers schedule a bit shorter, they might have to cut some money off of the worker's paycheck or something similar. I can incorporate this into my Shakespeare play because the government can be trying to do something for the better, and it so happens to be for the benefit for the country. For some people, they might rebel, and might fight back. I dont know my peers well enough to know their reaction on this topic.

Topic: Brazilian Police Probe Whether Water Utility Treats Sewage

Police in Brazil are investigating Rio de Janeiro's water utility because they believe its failing to filter, or failing, to treat the sewage in the river. At least six of the investigators are taking samples from around six of Rios main sewage treatment plants for testing. The plants (located on lagoons, near the Olympic Park and Guanabara Bay) are suppose to be holding the 2016 Olympics there. One of the officers said that the tests could lead to charges (because of sewage) and theft against the utility. 

I believe that the police should probably investigate because the 2016 Olympics is being hosted close to the sewage leak in Rio de Janeiro. The sewage can also affect peoples live, affecting their water for drinking, washing, cleaning, and multiple other things as well. This can be incorporated into my Shakespeare play as some massive leakage in a nearby creek, and it affects the nearby neighborhoods, and people have to investigate it. Dont know my peers well enough to know their opinion on the sewage leak, unless they like watching the Olympics.

Topic: Commuter Rail Crash Injuries Dozens in Costa Rica

Article/Sources: http://goo.gl/8EKdiX Fox News

Story Published: April 8, 2016



Two commuter trains collided a few kilometers west of San Jose, Costa Rica. Red Cross has reported at least 50-100 people requiring medical help , and several in delicate conditions. A couple of videos have shown workers attending to hurt passengers. A few hundred have been checked for any serious injuries, and the collision has soon to be inspected.

The collision of the two trains is horrible because many loved ones have been hurt, while others are being treated/examined for injuries. I pray for those injured and the ones being examined, and for their families because of the horrible train wreck that has occurred. This news story can be incorporated into a remake of a Shakespeare play by having a survivor be in there, and telling his/her side of the story, and have a vlog/someone video-taping them as their life/lives go on. I do not know my peers well enough to address their opinions on this matter.
