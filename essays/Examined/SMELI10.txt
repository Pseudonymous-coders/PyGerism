Summary: U.S. intelligence estimates now put the number of ISIS fighters in Libya between 4,000 to 6,000, double the number in the war-ravaged country last year, according to the top U.S. military commander in Africa. Wracked by violence since the fall of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, Libya has become a haven for militant groups. There are many people from libya that are now pledging to ISIS. US wants to keep a close eye on libya. If there any threats they will go after the target by using air strikes. In this past december they just killed the ISIS senior leader. 

Personal Beliefs: The US government continues to track ISIS by finding the number of members they have. In order to stop them from expanding even more the set up air strikes. If the expansion of ISIS continues there will be more terror attacks in the world. We have to stop there expansion rate before something bad happens in Libya.

Summary: To gain territory the Houthis take over inforce corruption in residential areas of Taez.Many resistance fighters have been killed in the process. The Houthis have continued to invade residential areas and the result being 10 civilians dead since tuesday. Shells from northern Yemen also killed two people in a Saudi town, the Saudi civil defence agency said, in a rare breach of a calm in the border area agreed with Iran-backed rebels early last month. The Saudi-led coalition of mostly Arab states on March 9 stated that after negotiations through tribal mediators, it had agreed to an exchange of prisoners and a state of calm" along the Saudi-Yemeni border to enable the delivery of desperately needed aid. Now that the Houthis, saudi coalition, have killed many on the Saudi-yemen border it has created a conflict and tension along the treaty. 

Personal Beliefs: This just grows the tension between Yemen and Saudi. The Houthis are getting their weapons from yemen and killing people in saudi town which is causing Saudi to think that Yemen is supporting the Houthis. They even recently formed a treaty which each other. That looks really bad on Yemen cause it looking like they are looking against Saudi even they have a treaty together. This links with the play the tempest by William Shakespeare because in the play there is a lot of betrayal.

Article: The Latest: Greece: 2 Weeks or More to Fix Deportations

Summary: Greece is trying to fix a plan to deport the several several thousand immigrants from Syria and Iraq.  Greece wants to send these immigrants to Turkey. The 6,750 immigrants are applying for asylum and there is a lack of qualified officials such as translators to process the applications. That is the reason why they are sending the immigrants to Turkey because there are more arabic speaker and translators there. Also all of the balkan countries north of greece have closed all of their borders. France said once some of the immigrants arrive in turkey they will take about 200. 11 people trying to get to Greece were aboard the 3.5-meter boat. That shows what these immigrants are will to do just to live in Greece. Migrant flows into Greece have slowed considerably recently following an EU-Turkey deal to deport migrants from Greek islands.

Personal Beliefs:  This is will not end well if the Greece government continues to let the immigrants come to their country. Greece should just close all of their borders like the other balkan countries north of them. They should deport them all to Turkey as fast as possible so that the ones eligible for an asylum can get one and the ones who get rejected or did it applied gets deported to where they came from. This would make sure that there will not be over-population in greece.
