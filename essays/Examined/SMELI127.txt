There is believed to be a second attack of isis at the Euro 2016 soccer game. This was found out when police found a suspect possibly involved in the Brustles attack, Mohamed Abrini, gave them this information. The police are currently trying to verify this information.The Euro 2016 soccer game is still said to continue until further notice despite the safety concerns of local citizens. They have much reason to be concerned about this as there was a suicide bombing outside the stadium in november. CNN believes they tried to get in but failed as their eye witnesses saw them try to get inside the stadium. 



In my opinion the soccer game should just be canceled in the best interests of the citizens safety after already being suspected as a target. At the very least all citizens should be warned of this risk before entering the stadium or even before buying tickets to this event. I think any possible targets should be evacuated and everyone warned about these targets and their locations. I cant think of anything this bad even in shakespeare.

It's not a new fact that women are still paid less over the years. After all of our rights have been assured men still get paid more for equal labor. Some of the most powerful women in America have still been paid less than their male counterparts. There is however a way to close the gap in pay. More and more women are being allowed in as board directors they help influence decisions to give women equal pay. If they have no women as board directors it will be obvious they lack gender equality so if a woman works up to it they can get to the top and help all women receive equal pay.



While some feminist arguments I don't believe are true this one i can really get behind because it's supported with facts of the lack of gender equality. I believe this will make U.S a better place for women in the workforce so they can feed their families just as well as the men. This is a lot like the gender equality issues in the 12th night where a girl is forced to dress as a man for survival in a new country.

A man aboard an Egypt air airplane took a #HijackSelfie. This #HijackSelfie was taken aboard a plane Cairo Bound by Ben Innes. In this selfie he is seen with the hijacker next to him and what looks like explosives strapped to Mr. Innes. These explosives were later proved to be fake but the picture with the hijacker is the real deal. Now Egypt will have to increase the airline security after the plane got hijacked but atleast they know who did it thanks to one stupid selfie.



I think the selfie was just ludicrous to be doing when someone is hijacking a plane. While i do believe it was ridiculous it was helpful in the end. I still believe that it was the last thing to do in a crisis. I dont know enough shakespeare to compare this news story to.
