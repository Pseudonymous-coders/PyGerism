Article: Donald Trump would 'cut off cash to Mexico' to pay for border wall

Donald Trump's is the leading candidate at the moment for the current election. Donald Trump's first priority is to build a wall to stop criminals, drug dealers/addicts from entering the U.S. But he wants the country of Mexico to pay for it. The cost would be about $5-10 billion dollars. SInce this is a big amount and and the fact that it's really unlikely for Mexico to pay such a big price for something they dont want, Donald Trump would stop the income for all mexicans and cut their cash sent home. He thinks this will make Mexico pay for the wall. Many people such as barack obama have said for this plan to be half-baked or unworkable.



In my opinion building a wall for all illegal mexicans is fair, and should be done, and there is nothing wrong with it. But making the Mexico pay for it, in my opinion is wrong. Just because a couple of mexican criminals and drug dealers cross the border illegally, that doesn't mean that the whole Mexico has to be punished and have to pay for the wall. In my opinion, since its Donald Trumps idea and his problem about the trespassing mexicans, he/America should pay for the wall and not the Mexicans.

In Venezuela there has been a very deadly and large Zika virus. And this virus has been spreading around like crazy. There has been over 142,000 deadly cases of the Zika virus. The cause of this deadly virus is the Aedes mosquito that carries this virus around. And because of this virus spreading around so quick, there has been a shortage of doctors, medicine, supplies, and space in the hospitals. People say little by little the medical help is disappearing. When this virus first started, Venezuela did not take it seriously and ignored it. While other countries around it took precautions and were prepared. Now Venezuela is in a big sinkhole of thousands and thousands of people getting sick and not enough medicine.



In my opinion this problem would not have started if venezuela had been precautions of their problems before, so none of this would have happened. I also think that other countries should donate a little bit of medicine to venezuela so that they will have enough to solve their problem. If every country helps then the venezuelan Zika problem can get better, and will give Venezuela another chance to take precautions. Right now venezuela's problem is not going to get better if not worse.

In Brazil, a beloved predecessor, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, has been jailed and the people of Brazil are going crazy. There is also a un-wanted and deeply unpopular President, Dilma Rousseff who is corrupt and who the people of Brazil want to call an impeachment on. Protests were reported in every state in Brazil. People wearing yellow and green Brazil national soccer team shirts and singing the national anthem would protest on the streets. They also denounced a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal involving bribes and kickbacks on fat contracts at the state-run oil company, Petrobras. That scandal has led to the jailing of politicians from Rousseffs Workers Party and its coalition allies. There were At least 450,000 people filled Sao Paulos central Paulista Avenue; 100,000 people in Brasilia;  120,000 in Recife and 160,000 in Curitiba. These riots and protesting has shrunk Brazils economy by 3.8 percent. After Lula was freed, there were riots from the other side, protesting about Lula getting out of jail.



In my opinion there should be a government like the U.S in Brazil. So there wouldn't be protests about who got elected and who did not. I think the people themselves should vote and pick their leaders. I also think that it's the government's duty to stop corruption from happening.
