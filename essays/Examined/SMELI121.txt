Article: Cyprus works to extradite EgyptAir hijacking suspect to Egypt

An Egyptian request to extradite a man was made recently in Cyprus. Authorities say that 59-year-old Seif Eddin Mustafa admitted to hijacking an EgyptAir flight with a fake suicide belt. Petros Clerides told The Associated Press that the victim is objecting to extradition and has hired a lawyer for his hearing that has been scheduled for April 22. Mustafa was described by Cypriot authorities as psychologically unstable, accused of forcing a flight from Alexandria to Cairo to make an unscheduled landing in Cyprus last week. Mustafa continues to plead his claim that he had been strapped with the explosives. Mustafa's arrest after the hijacking ended peacefully, though rather abruptly, after only six hours when he stepped off the aircraft and attempted to flee. A Cyprus court last tried  Mustafa, with preliminary charges and he was freed that Thursday, but he was rearrested after a warrant for the extradition proceedings was issued. His motives are still unknown, but the matter is still being investigated.



I agree with the decision to extradite Mustafa especially if he was caught fleeing from his crime.  Now that I am writing this I know that he told the women and the children that they could escape. Then he announced that all Egyptians and others from Muslim backgrounds would be allowed to escape from the plane. I think that this news story relates to the Twelfth Night because they are both about fleeing from wrecked transport in search of a better life. They both have common themes of treating the women differently than the men as well.

Article: Chad: President in power since 1990 seeks another term

Sunday, April 10, 2016, Chadian President Idriss Dby, after more than 25 years of power in this central African nation, battled it out against more than a dozen electoral rivals as he seeks yet another presidential term. This election came in the middle of a crucial time for Chad, as the international concern for their human rights record continues to grow. Idriss Dby, who has been on the high perch since 1990, is now competing in a debate with quite a few other candidates, more than he has ever been up against before. Though many see his cooperation with the international militaries, including the French, U.S., Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria, as international acceptance of Dby's leadership, not everyone is sees eye-to-eye on that matter and as a result of Chad's support for the anti-extremist battle, the country has been attacked by Boko Haram. Thibaud Lesueur, a central African senior analyst for the International Crisis Group says that this election could be one of the toughest challenges he has faced, and as the the Islamic militant threat continues to grow the election may become the least of their worries. The Islamic group, which is based in northeastern Nigeria, is both close and strong, their attack of choice: terrorist suicide bombings. This desperately poor country is in need for a great leader, and the question remains, Is Idriss Dby that man?



I cant say that I know much about President Idriss Dbys previous years in office, but from what I have learned he seems to have made quite a few good calls for his country, such as leading the government to start building the country's first oil pipeline. I think that this news story relates to King Lear because they are both about finding a new leader who upholds the values that the people they govern need.

Article: Sitting Ducks? ISIS threatens American troops in Egypt's Sinai

At the Pentagon on Wednesday, April 6, a senior U.S. military leader said that the U.S., Israeli and Egyptian governments would be discussing matter at the highest levels concerning the future size of the U.S. commitment to Sinai. The hundreds of American forces currently positioned at the peninsula appeared to easy victims for the Islamic forces and fears were only made stronger when ISIS claimed responsibility for the roadside bomb that injured four U.S. soldiers. And in the end the final decision was made; troops will not be withdrawn from Sinai, however officials are still concerned for the troops safety. The threat is increasing, said an official, Almost everything has changed in the last few years, agreed Paul Salem, of the Washington-based Middle East Institute. Now there's a full-on battle between ISIS and the Egyptian army. Over a decade ago we attempted to pull our troops out of the dangerous region, but  Israel and Egypt have resisted calls. This, of course, caused a dilemma with the Pentagon and the White House as the lives of 700 U.S. troops hang in the balance. Its a tough call, and no country wants to appear to be giving into ISIS but the lives of the noble men and women fighting for our country are more important.



I completely, and wholeheartedly disagree with the decision to leave the 700 U.S. troops in a region where they are struggling to survive and being targeted by terrorists. I understand that my opinion is biased as I come from a long line of veterans, and the thought of any of them at the mercy of Islamic extremists is terrifying, but I can easily say that President Obamas decisions concerning the safety of our nation's military have been, in my opinion, bad. I think that this news story relates to MAcBeth because they are both about war and the price of mortality.
