 The death toll from yellow fever outbreak in Angola has risen to 225, with an estimated 1,600 cases now recorded, Health Minister Luis Sambo said on Tuesday. Yellow fever is a virus spread to humans through mosquitoes. It is most common is areas where the Aedes aegypti mosquito thrives, such as Africa and South America. Symptoms will start to show a few days after the mosquito bites. The majority of the infectees will be okay after the first phase of symptoms, but some will obtain more serious ones. Yellow fever is diagnosed through the process of a blood test to see if there are antibodies against the virus present. Due to the fact that there is no cure for this disease, the only available treatment is supportive care. Most patients with yellow fever in the advanced stages need to be in the hospital to support vital functions. There is a vaccine to help prevent yellow fever and is highly recommended for high risk groups. Yellow fever is a serious problem and additional steps need to be taken to ensure protection.  

I believe that if a person is traveling to a country in the region that has the infectious mosquitoes, they should be required to get the vaccination. Further research should be conducted to gain a better understanding of yellow fever, and to hopefully come up with a cure. I do no see a connection to Shakespeare.

Article: South African president faces growing calls to resign over spending scandal

South African President Jacob Zuma is facing calls to resign after a spending scandal. A coalition of church, academic and other groups are beginning to form a protest campaign against Zuma who did apologize after the top court in the country ruled that he violated the constitution  in a scandal over millions of dollars in state spending on his private home. Parliament voted on impeachment of the president. Important South Africans that say Jacob Zuma should resign include Trevor Manuel, a former finance minister, and Ahmed Kathrada, a former anti-apartheid activist who was close to Nelson Mandela.

I think that Zuma should be fired for what he did. He used the money that could have been used to help the people of his country on personal things. Although Zuma might be a good guy at heart, these actions prove otherwise. In my opinion, the next steps taken should include punishment for Zuma and looking for new candidates for president.  I do not see a connection to Shakespeare.

In the Ivory Coast, the U.N. plans to double the number of peacekeepers in the area due to a clash in March between farmers and herders. This dispute killed 20 and sent over 1,000 people to Burkina Faso. Mission spokeswoman Kadidia Ledron said Tuesday that 400 U.N. troops  up from 200  will be stationed in the Bounkani region along with reinforcements from Ivory Coast's army. Yaya Sanu, high commissioner of Burkina Faso's Noumbiel province, said Monday that local officials recorded 1,312 people fleeing the clashes. 

I believe that the people who had to flee Ivory Coast should be guaranteed safety, and the farmers and herders should be forced to relocate. With 20 dead already, the situation has gotten out of hand. There are thousands of people's lives at risk here, and no chances should be taken. I do not see a connection to Shakespeare.
