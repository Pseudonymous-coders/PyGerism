Article:Terrorist Bombings Strike Brussels: What We Know

On the morning of March 22, 2016, more than 30 were killed and over 200 wounded after two bombs were set off in an airport and another in a train station. Later that day Isis claimed responsibility for the bombings via the Amaq News Agency. It was soon discovered that two suicide attackers struck the Zaventem Airport at around 8 A.M local time.The explosions hit near the departure gates, collapsing ceiling panels and shattering glass windows. According to Belgian media outlets the attack began after a burst of gunfire and yelling in Arabic. Around an hour later another explosion hit a metro train in Maelbeek Station killing 20 people and wounding about 130 people. The explosions not only sent the rail station into mass chaos but it also caused panic in the European Union headquarters which are near the station, in the citys center. In response to the attacks the immediate area was on high alert and explosive teams from the Belgian army detonated a suspicious package at the Zaventem airport in the early afternoon. Also, the federal Zuidertoren building in Brussels was evacuated after suspicious items were found in its underground parking lot. Brussels was placed under lockdown and children were not allowed to leave schools. All around, Europe governments have increased their awareness to terrorist attacks due to the Brussels attacks. Suspicions have been made that the reason for this attack was because of the arrest of Salah Abdeslam, a central suspect in the attacks in paris.

So far it doesnt seem like any real lengths have been made to stop terrorism. I think that Brussels was most likely attacked because of the arrest of Salah Abdeslam, and I think that Obama is correct when he says that the world must unite but I dont see anything actually happening to make that a reality. I dont think a terrorist attack can relate to Shakespeare in any way, but if it does I dont really know that much about Shakespeare to make a connection.

Article: N. Ireland woman who induced abortion given suspended prison term



Date: April 5th 2016

At age 19 the woman, who will not be named for legal reasons, lacked money to travel to England for an abortion. She is now 21 and has received a three month suspension prison term. The woman pleaded guilty to procuring her abortion by using a poison and supplying a position with the intent of causing a miscarriage. The woman said that since she couldnt go to the clinic in England, she called them and they told her about two drugs online that would induce abortion. She then bought the drugs and the fetus was aborted. So why is this such a big deal? According to a North Ireland law  "Every woman, being with child, who, with intent to procure her own miscarriage shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing ... shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable to be kept in penal servitude for life."

But she only received 3 months of suspension prison. Many anti-abortion groups disagree with this ruling and are demanding that the woman gets sentenced to life. Many famous political figures have addressed this ruling. Notably, Donald trump has given some answers to the question of whether a woman should be able to obtain an abortion within the law. He began with yes, but ended with a no, saying that the woman, and the fetus, is a victim in a case like this. This is also happening as Poland considers a complete ban on abortion. A letter from Catholic bishops promoting the ban was read in churches last sunday, further provoking the protests across the nation about abortion.

This is obviously a problem in our world today. I agree with the church in that abortion should be banned. Things happen for a reason. Of course there could be some special cases in which it would be appropriate to have an abortion, but otherwise it should be banned. I also think that when a decision is made it should be made very clear to the public that the decision has been made. Right now it seems that some people think one thing and others think another. I dont know of any plays from Shakespeare that this relates to.

Article: Greece sends first migrants back to Turkey under new EU deal

The first Migrants to be deported from Greece as part of a new EU plan to try and fix the migration crisis have landed in Turkey. Three boats carrying 202 people left the Greek islands of Lesbos and Chios in the early morning. Greek authorities said that the majority of them were from Pakistan, with others from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India,Syria, and 42 people from Afghanistan. According to Greek officials, the migrants did not apply for asylum. Turkey has agreed to accept up to 500 migrants per day. These migrants are the first to be deported from Greece by a one in, one out deal made between the European Union and Turkey last month. The deal states that for every Syrian sent back to Turkey, a vetted Syrian refugee will go from Turkey to Europe to be resettled. The maximum number is capped at 72,000 migrants for the deal. In return, the UR will give Turkey billions in funding to help it provide a better home for the migrants within its borders. It has also been revealed that Syrian migrants who are deported to Turkey will not be transported by boat like the first group, but instead be transported by plane and land in the southern city of Adana. From Adana, they will be sent to camps throughout Turkeys southeast.The EU says that this is a very important deal because it will take some of the stress off of Greece. Currently many migrants are stuck in Greece because all of the countries surrounding Greece has closed their borders to the migrants. By moving some of the migrants back to Greece, the EU hopes that the countries will lift their borders and allow for a smoother flow of migrants into the EU.  However, many people dont agree with this decision and say that neither Greece nor Turkey has the resources to house so many refugees.

I believe that it is a good idea to relieve Greece of the refugees and move some of them to Turkey. However I think that the countries surrounding Greece should also help in the effort so that the countries dont get overfilled with migrants and have to send them back home. I dont know of any Shakespeare plays that relate to migration, but one might be about trying to find a better life somewhere else and the struggles of doing so. I dont know many Shakespeare plays.
