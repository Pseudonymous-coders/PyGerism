Robotics researchers found a new way to build working robots using a 3D printer. The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseniy Yatseyuk has been asked and complied to the president Petro Poroshenko to resign from office. It involves printing solid and liquid materials simultaneously. The engineers think their method could soon be used by disaster relief organizations to deploy customised bots in dangerous environments. 

This article is very important for disaster relief organizations and is a step towards the future. Each advancement in the world, especially technology advancements, come into play for changing our world. Ukraine and most of the FSR world is heavily troubled with slow government action and extreme political corruption. I cant say how this incorporates with Shakespeare, I havent been taught about it yet.

The much loved poet, born 246 years ago today, is known for his celebration of nature. There are many quotes William Wordsworth gifted the world with such as Nature never did betray the heart that loved her and That ocean is a mighty harmonious. We celebrate his birthday today to remember and appreciate his life with quotes of his own. 

This article is touching to those who love words but are in a generation in which is slowly being eaten away. Its important to not only focus on the future, but remember the past for thats how we got here to get to the future. I dont know my Shakespeare yet to say how this connects.

Article Title: Presidential Contenders Make Cautious Movie Picks

This article talks about all the 2016 presidential candidates favorite movies- it tells a lot about their character and is something true to learn about the contenders. Hillary Clinton counts the Wizards of Oz as her top pick, being a classic PG movie, while Donald Trump prefers Citizen Kane as his. A journalist stated once that Trump wants to be king of all media, king of the world. That's who Citizen Kane was. John Kasich favors a comedy film, School of Rock- a light, musical movie. 

This article was very interesting to me and helped me understand the candidates personalities a little deeper. Although a light subject, top movie picks can show a lot about a person. Cute article with meaning. I cant connect this to Shakespeare for I dont know much about it yet.
