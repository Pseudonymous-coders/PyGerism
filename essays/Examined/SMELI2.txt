Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would be establishing a National Guard in Russia. The guard would be made of interior ministry troops and be used to fight terrorism and organized crime. Many suspect the timing of the creation of the guard has something to do with the upcoming elections and Putins fear of civil unrest. Viktor Zolotov, Putins body guard, would be leading the guard and will report directly to the President. The proposed powers of the new guard include entering private property while on duty if civilian lives are at risk and the authority to use force without warning. The guard could include up to 400,000 people and have access to heavy artillery and tanks.



I agree that the timing of the creation of this National Guard is a bit suspicious due to the upcoming elections are civil unrest. Also the powers of the National Guard make the guard seem more for controlling large masses of people and not for just fighting organized crime and terrorism. Especially due to the size of the national guard. This event could relate to Shakespeares Macbeth because Macbeth has to squish a rebellion that is being led against

Him by someone who knows he is an evil man.

Article: Azerbaijan Claims a Ceasefire in Deadly Feud; Armenia Says Violence Still Going

Azerbaijan announced a ceasefire of the recently turned deadly feud between them and Armenia after dozens of soldiers from both sides were killed. Although the ceasefire was announced, the Armenian News Agency said that Azerbaijan was still attacking with missile. Azerbaijan stated that they will stop attacking, but will respond to any provocations from the other country. The U.S weighed in on the situation and called for both sides to start negotiating and striving towards a peaceful solution.



I agree with the U.Ss State Department which stated that both sides should try to find a peaceful solution to the current conflicts. Both sides have lost many soldiers since the countries feud became deadly and there is no need for more soldiers to die. Azerbaijan was smart to call a ceasefire, but announcing that they would respond to provocations, in my opinion, isnt the best way to start striving towards peace. This conflict is very similar to the feud between the two families in Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet, because even though there isnt always a major conflict both families are quick to fight members from the opposing family.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists claimed they found documents proving that Russian President Vladimir Putin was hiding and keeping large sums of money in offshore companies. Many believe this to be another attempt to make the president look bad before the primary elections later this year. The documents said to have been discovered not only implicate the Russian President, but 12 other world leaders. While some of these leaders have already denied the accusations, no one is expecting the Russian government to say anything due to them being used to attempts to make the president look bad.



From what I know it does not seem uncommon for important politicians to hide funds and wealth. It does seem unlikely that 12 other world leaders would also keep their wealth hidden in the same place as a bunch of other important people. CNN has not yet verified these documents leading me to believe that they might not be entirely true and are being used to make some world leaders look bad in the eye of the public. I do not see a connection between this and Shakespeare.
