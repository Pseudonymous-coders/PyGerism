Title: Born Free, Killed by Hate

In this article Born Free Killed by Hate by James Fletcher it talks about the consequences of being gay in South Africa. The article starts by talking about Pasca Melamus murder and how it sparked three different LGBT groups to protest and fight the police on how they treat crimes involving gay people. Also it mentions the background of being gay in South Africa and how they were the first to protect people from hate crimes.            South Africa's constitution was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation. The country was also the first in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage. But after a spate of murders, gay people say more needs to be done to stop hate crimes.      



This Article would be good for a Twelfth Night retelling because of Viola dressing as a man, cross dressing a common thing among LGBT, and how if that got out she could be in serious danger of being killed or raped.

Sudan's Omar al-Bashir 'to step down in 2020' is about the current ruler in Sudan and all the accusations made against him of being crooked and an all around awful guy.  It starts by giving you a glance at what hes been proven to do and then goes into what hes been accused of doing.  Next they address the Darfur situation and how he is implicated in it.





This Article would be great for MacBeth, you could do it on how someone who is close to the ruler of Omar Al-Bashir is forcing/blackmailing him out to take over or how theyre plotting to take over once he steps down. Another idea is a soldier who is fighting in darfur secretly plots to take over after being told hes better than the current leader by village people of other soldiers.

This article is about the Sudan region of Darfur is voting on The referendum over whether to remain as five states or form a single region runs until Wednesday.  The people want the fighting in the region to stop because it has caused over 100,000 deaths. The referendum is the last step in a peace process negotiated in Doha. Rebels have long requested more regional powers to end what they see as Khartoum's interference in land ownership conflicts. . It also discusses how people may boycott the vote who initially wanted it because it will be unfair because Bashir is supporting the rebels.



You could use this for King Lear if you go really loose with the retelling and make the daughters the different regions of Darfur and Bashir the King/Father.
