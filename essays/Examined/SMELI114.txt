The Panama Papers are 11.5 million documents containing information about corruption of world leaders. It documents leaders using offshore accounts in Mossack Fonseca. An offshore account is a way for people to avoid paying taxes and give money secretly. Imagine you have a bank that your mom check every day and takes a little bit out everyday. Your friend Tim will let you put your bank at his house where his mom wont check the balance and will let you do whatever you want with your money. That is how offshore accounts work. Mossack Fonseca is based in Panama where taxing is a lot more loose which allows for this type of corruption. 12 world leaders, from Putin to David Cameron, and 143 politicians were in these Panama Papers.  According to The Guardian and The Atlantic, Putin has associates in these papers. As said by The Guardian  A $2bn trail leads all the way to Vladimir Putin. The Russian presidents best friend  a cellist called Sergei Roldugin  is at the centre of a scheme in which money from Russian state banks is hidden offshore. Some of it ends up in a ski resort where in 2013 Putins daughter Katerina got married. Putin bought paid millions of dollars to people including a 4 million dollar yacht. This is a large problem in Russia because their leader is part of corruption. People in Russia are very upset because they feel like their leader is corrupt which makes a disconnect between the people and the government. A government owned television network didnt share the information about the news which shows even more corruption in the Russian Government. 

I think that it is scary that the world's leaders could be corrupt. I look at the whole corruption as a struggle for power as that is what they want. I think that this could relate with the story of Macbeth because Macbeth is about wanting power and corruption. If we did this news story with Macbeth, I think that we could make the trailer a very interesting movie.

Topic: The EU in voting if Ukraine could be in the EU



Article: EU and Ukraine

Date: 4/6/2016

This story is about how countries in the EU, such as the Netherlands, voted for Ukraine to join the EU. The EU is a group of countries in Europe where they use the same currency, have less border security, and have better trade. Ukraine wants to leave the Former Soviet Countries and join the economic prosperous countries in the EU. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko insisted his country would continue our movement towards the EU. A majority of Ukraine wants to be in the EU, but some of the EU does not want them to join.  The Netherlands have recently held a election to see if Ukraine could join. 61.1% of voters in the Netherlands did not want Ukraine to be apart of the EU. This has created a problem for The Netherlands. BBC said, The result creates a headache for the Dutch government, as the Dutch parliament approved the EU association agreement with Ukraine last year. All the other 27 EU member states have already ratified the deal. People who are anti-EU love this because they feel li. ke this is the beginning of the end for the EU. Even though The Netherlands does not want Ukraine in the EU, There is a huge amount of political will, both among top EU officials and powerful EU member states, namely Germany, for Ukraine's post-revolutionary political order to succeed. According to the article, the reason that people in The Netherlands didnt vote for Ukraine is that Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine have widely been blamed for the killing of 298 people when a Malaysia Airlines flight from Amsterdam was shot down in July 2014. The Netherlands lost 193 of its citizens. 

I understand both sides of this issue. If I was Ukraine, I would want to be in the EU just because of what it would do for the economical state of the country. I think that a whole continent of support would do more than Russia. At the other end, there are some people who want the Ukraine to stay out of the EU and they will fight their way. Cough Crimea cough. I think that this issue will change the economy for the next decade because of the impact it has of Europe and Russia. I had trouble thinking of how this could relate to Shakespeare.

Topic: Putin creates new National Guard in Russia 'to fight terrorism'



Article: National Guard 

Date: 4/6/2016

Russia created a National Guard that was able to fight terrorism. This will be be led by  Viktor Zolotov who is a close ally to Putin. Russia said it will be used to keep order in Russia, but many people feel like this will not happen. The headline of the article says 'to fight terrorism'

which shows that the BBC does not think that this National Guard is not used for what is. Some critics of Putin say he was scared about an unrest. Liberal Yabloko party leader Emilia Slabunova said it was an "attempt by the authorities to protect themselves from protests" while independent military analyst Alexander Golts said Russian authorities were concerned by "colour revolutions" in neighbouring countries such as Ukraine and Georgia. Russia has come back to the hatred by saying "an absolutely timely, adequate and systematic answer to modern challenges and threats." The National Guard looks set to become a powerful force. Its proposed powers include the right to shoot or use force without warning and enter private premises while on duty when there is a threat to the lives of civilians or National Guard personnel. Many protesters took to the streets to protest the guard saying it gets ride of a lot of their freedom. This is the perfect time for Putin to do something like this because of the fear that terrorist have created. 

When I look at this I think of Soviet Russia and Stalins secret police. When I have looked through articles about Putin, it seems like he is corrupt. I think that it is scary when thinking of one of the worlds most influential country's leaders is corrupt. This story could fit in with any play about corruption such as Hamlet or Macbeth.
