Topic: US strike kills '150 al-Shabaab terrorists' in Somalia

Summary:

America executed a fatal attack using aircraft that was flown by people. This took place in the Hiran region of Somalia, about 120 miles north of the capital, Mogadishu. There have been about 20 raids in Somalia since 2007 to 2016. This most recent attack killed 150 people though. The terrorist group, al-Shabaab, was once a part of al-Qaeda. Al-Shabaab took responsibility for a massacre in Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, which killed 63 people in 2013, they also killed 148 people in a university in Kenya. This aircraft attack from the United States only killed 2 percent of all of the terrorists in al-Shabaab.

How it relates to Shakespeare:

This article relates to Romeo and Juliet because Romeo best friend, Mercutio, is killed when Romeo attempts to break up the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt. Grief-stricken and wracked with guilt, Romeo confronts and slays Tybalt.This relates to this killing of terrorists because the terrorists hurt people that America was fond of, which angered America and caused them to kill some of the terrorists. I think that terrorists should not be killed, they should have to suffer by being in solitude. I do not feel bad that the terrorists died, but I think that there were other ways to handle this situation.

Topic: Police seek 10 in connection with fire at Indian temple that killed 109 people

Summary:

In the southern Indian city of Kollam, a temple caught on fire due to pyrotechnics (special effects involving fire) close to the ground and fireworks going on inside of the temple. According to the police the temple was not permitted to have fireworks and sparklers indoors. This fire resulted in the deaths of over 100 people, and over 300 people were injured. The families of those who died will be getting 3,000 dollars and the people who got injured will be getting 751 dollars as sympathy. The Duke and Duchess travelled to India to pay their condolences and they held a prayer for all of the dead and injured.

How it relates to Shakespeare:

I do not see any resemblance to Shakespeare in this article. I feel like the temple staff should have been more responsible and not have disobeyed the police. It is nice of the government to compensate for the losses of the families by giving them money, but it does not bring anyone back nor does it reduce their grief.

Topic: John Kerry: ISIS responsible for genocide

Summary: 

The Secretary of State, John Kerry, has said that ISIS is carrying out a genocide against the Yazidis and other people who are either Christian or Shiite Muslims in Iraq and Syria. ISIS has been kidnapping the Yazidi women and girls and selling them and many other unspeakable things. ISIS also forced Christian women into slavery. This is the first time since 2004 that America has said there is a genocide going on. This declare of genocide does not mean that the U.S. can do anything, but they are planning on making the military stronger. Most political people agree that this killing is a genocide and that these people being killed need more respect.

How it relates to Shakespeare:

This article relates to Macbeth by Shakespeare. This is because ISIS founder was normal at first but later on he/she got power hungry, which is causing them to kill everyone to get to the top of the world and rule all countries. I think that ISIS should not have done that, people have their differences and wiping out an ethnicity or a religion wont fix anything. When people are killed, there is more problems that are caused. We dont need more genocides in the world because they cause more anger.
