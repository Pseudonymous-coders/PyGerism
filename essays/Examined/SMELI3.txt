Title: Latin America Exposed: The Panama Papers

On April 3, 2016, 1.5 million documents from the database of the Mossack Fonseca law firm, whose headquarters are in Panama City, Panama, were leaked. These documents revealed the financial dealings of many political officials and rich, powerful leaders, including some individuals from Latin America. These offshore accounts showed that many of these people were placing their money in these accounts to avoid being taxed. The leak has also revealed names of drug trafficking organizations and terrorism links. Although no American officials have been found to have been involved, over time more information could be revealed. The Panama Papers are causing problems for Latin America not only because the headquarters of the law firm were in Panama, but because many Latin American leaders and politicians were involved. The leak of the Panama Papers has tainted Panama and could damage alliances with other countries. Although there are many accusations, the law firm of Mossack Fonseca claims that nothing they did was illegal and so president Juan Carlos Varela stated that the government would cooperate and continue with investigations of the law firm. Recently there has been no new developments but time will most likely reveal more information that will affect not only Latin America but many other countries as well.



In my opinion, these offshore accounts should be illegal instead of just being immoral. It is unfair for important officials and rich individuals to have access to someplace where they can avoid taxes. Because they are finding these loopholes, it is unfair to the lower class who have no ability to get around the law, and legally none the less. I also think that the Mossack Fonseca law firm should not try to deny the accusations because it will only make the situation worse.

With the presidential elections happening, Trump has said many things throughout his campaign that trouble many Mexicans. Trump states that he believes that illegal Mexican immigrants should be deported back to Mexico and have a wall built along the border between the US and Mexico. Many of these Mexican immigrants help provide for their families back in Mexico and if they were to be deported, it would be very difficult to find and keep a job. Therefore putting their family into poverty. Dona Irlanda Lujano lives in Cuautapec, Mexico in a poor area. She has two sons, who are illegal immigrants, who she relies on for remittances. She receives $100 to $150 every month which enables her family to live. For a very long time, Mexican officials have refused to comment publicly but recently Foreign Secretary Claudia Ruiz Massieu stated that President Enrique Pena Nieto compared Mr. Trumps strident tone to that of Hitler and Mussolini.. Vicente Fox responded to Trumps demand that Mexico pay for a border wall with a strong exclamation and assured that Mexico would not pay for the wall. The disagreement and conflict between Trump and the Mexicans has affected not only Mexican families but the US as well. The previous relationship between the two nations has been damaged. For example, the NAFTA treaty could possibly be in danger of resolution.



I think that the illegal immigrants should not be deported because immigrants are what America started from: to deport them all because they are illegal would be going against what this country is made of. The Mexicans should continue fighting for their beliefs and the United States should try to mend the relationship between the two countries. I also think that if Trump does build a wall, I agree with Fox when he stated that the Mexicans will not pay for the border wall to be created.

Title: Colombians voice their views on the peace process

In Colombia, the government and the largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia- or FARC- have been in conflict for some time now. The FARC wants peace in the country and the government has been trying to compromise but civilians and members of the FARC believe that the government is not strong enough to bring peace throughout the country. By trying to bring peace, the government has agreed to formally talk to the second-largest guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN). However many people dont believe that this alone will bring peace. I have no confidence in the peace process because the guerrilla groups have a very long presence in Colombia. says Francisco Augusto Preciado Alarcon a 31-year-old construction worker. Others, like Cesar Saleh, believe that eventually peace will exist in Colombia no matter who wins the current war. Many Colombians want peace because there would be more employment, the quality of life would be better, and that education quality can increase as well. However some people think that a peace treaty is out-of-reach and could never be successful, and on the slight chance that it is successful, then it would not drastically change or affect very many people. If peace were to be achieved, then Colombia would become a more stable country which could both benefit themselves and other countries as well.



I think that the FARC and the government should try to create peace because it would make the country better as a whole. It would have better education systems, more employment options, and the quality of life would improve. This would make the country more economically stable which would make the country more pleasing to make an alliance with. If the country is seen as a strong and sound nation, then there would be more opportunities to join forces and to have a better reputation.
