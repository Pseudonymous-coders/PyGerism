Topic:  South African President Jacob Zuma says he'll abide by ruling he broke law

Article: South African President Jacob Zuma says he'll abide by ruling he broke law  /  South Africa's Jacob Zuma defied constitution, top court rules



        Jacob Zuma, the president of South Africa, wasted $15 million--belonging to his government--on upgrading his own private home. The president broke the law by upgrading his own home with non-security things, but instead with luxury items. The court demanded that Zuma must repay a part of the $15 million that he used.  The president accepted the courts decision, and stated that never knowingly or deliberately set out to violate the constitution, which is the supreme law of the land. The people of the country are upset with the president and want him to pay back all of their countrys money. They have been trying to impeach him but the government has said that he didnt do anything wrong and they have been outraged at the president. The importance of this article is that it is not right if the president spends $15 million on unnecessary things for their home and then pay back only a portion of it. It is unfair for the people and its not right that he gets to pay part of it. 

   In my perspective, it is selfish of President Zuma to waste the $15 million on his own personal use when he could have used it for repaying debts to other countries or making his own country better. Zumas actions made South Africans change their opinion on him and it made himself look like a selfish person in their eyes. It also made the people that arent from the country look at South Africa like the entirety of it is a selfish country, and will not help it out any time soon.

The connection to Shakespeare is that it is similar to King Lear with his use of money and property. In King Lear, the two evil daughters used the money and betrayed their family, like Zuma did his own.

Topic: Nigeria plans to send an astronaut to space by 2030

      

       In Nigeria, the people are planning to send an astronaut to space in 2030. They are doing this so that Nigeria can be involved in protecting its national interests. The people are going to go to China so they can meet with their partners, discuss the space mission, and invest in it. It is very important for Nigeria so they can benefit from going to space and it is essential to them. They stated that it will be a great challenge for them than their previous missions.  They want to achieve going to space and Nigeria wants to inspire all of Africa to go into space. 



    Space is an important thing to learn and grow from they will have the knowledge of knowing more about space that will be able to help them. It is very important for the country because they want to inspire a whole continent so they can move towards greatness in the coming future. This wouldnt connect to Shakespeare in my view of the topic.

Article: Uganda has first solar powered bus

Topic: Uganda unveils Africa's first solar-powered bus

  

        In Uganda they have revealed their first solar powered bus in Africa. They made a solar powered bus due to the fact they receive a lot of sunlight throughout the day so they took that opportunity to make a vehicle that is powered by the sun. The bus will have 2 batteries that will last the whole day and each battery takes one hour to charge. It is very important to the country because it will improve how they get energy. They want to expand on using the solar power energy and have it power homes and other buildings too. 

   In my view solar power is a very useful way of finding energy and conserving it in an efficient manner. It is a great resource of fuel that is renewable and can reduce pollution. I cant see this connecting to Shakespeare since it is talking about using an energy source.
