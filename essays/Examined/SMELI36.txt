The white house is advising congress that they need to take action against the Zika virus. According to the white house more funds will be needed to be prepared for the Zika outbreak. Currently the money that was for the Ebola virus has been moved to fund the Zika problem, but the white house says that we need more to be fully prepared for the Zika virus. This virus has been linked to microcephaly, a condition that causes babies to be born with undeveloped brains. This causes the babies to be born with small heads. The white house believes that until congress allows more funding we are at risk.   



World Health Organization has called the Zika problem a global health emergency. This means that we need to be ready for it. We should do whatever it takes to keep america safe. In this story the white house could be the three witches from Macbeth because they are creating a prophecy and congress is like Banquo because he is sceptical.

Article: Is the US presidential race 'rigged'?

The american presidential nomination process is not a true democracy. The votes that people make are not the final decision. The final decision is made handful of people called delegates. These delegates can make whatever decision they want. Americas votes dont really matter. Even Though Donald Trump is in the lead, behind the scene the delegates can still make their own decision. Ted Cruz, Donald Trumps competitor, has a team working to make their people become delegates. This also means that the delegates can be bribed. Maybe a day on Trumps golf course. The american election process is flawed and not a democracy. 



I think that people should have the right to vote for who they want. All of the power should not be in a select few of people. In the play Macbeth all of the decisions are made by a king. That king is not elected and has the right to make whatever decision he wants. Only a handful of people make all of the decisions.

President Obama will decide whether or not to release 28 pages regarding the 9/11 attacks in the next 60 days. Obama administrations have refused to unseal the documents saying that it would threaten national security. Some suspect that these documents show a Saudi connection to the 9/11 attacks. They believe the reluctance is to hide Saudi Arabias involvement in the attack. Many people are excited to finally know the truth. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand believes that the documents she has seen should be available to the families of 9/11 victims. Obama is under pressure to release the documents because he has a planned trip to Saudi Arabia. People believe that the documents should be released to the public before he makes that trip.



I believe that is not worth it to know what the documents say if it threatens national security. The is no point in releasing something that puts us in danger. No connection to Shakespeare.
