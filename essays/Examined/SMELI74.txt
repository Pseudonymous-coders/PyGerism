Topic: Seismic activity in Vanuatu

Article: Magnitude-6.9 Earthquake Hits Vanuatu

Date: 4/3/16

Vanuatu, one of the countries with the largest amounts of earthquakes, was hit by another rough earthquake recently, affecting 270,000 people. It already saw Cyclone Pam, the most powerful storm ever to make it to land, last year and is still trying to recover. Its development has been set back years, and recent earthquakes like this one are not helping.

I think that the people of Vanuatu are not getting the proper publicity over this in comparison to other situations. I had not even heard of Vanuatu until this article. Other places get less intense earthquakes and are on international news. Perhaps this is because there is a higher population affected and more building damage.

Topic: Executions in China

Article: China is the World's Top Executioner, but it doesn't want you to know that

China is believed to have more executions than any other country in the world. However, China does not publically release their full execution data. Amnesty, a human rights group, doesnt even put in Chinese execution data for 2015 because the Chinese government has not been honest with it in the past. China has wrongfully executed people before, and due to groups like Amnesty it has been slowly but surely improving by decreasing the number of capital crimes and executions in 2015 into 2016.

I believe that the number of executions does need to decrease, but I do not know if it should be eradicated entirely.  I have heard stories of dangerous people escaping jails and mental hospitals, and that combined with knowledge of people like Albert Fish worries me. However, the justice system is never 100%, so wrong people get executed, as seen with the incident in China.

Topic: North Korean Nuclear Program

Article: 38 North: Suspicious Activity Noted at North Korean Nuclear Site

Satellites monitoring a North Korean nuclear site recorded exhaust plumes over the past few weeks. This means that the site is being heated, and this warns of possible nuclear production although nothing is certain. However, Pyongyang has announced that he wants to refurbish and restart the nuclear sites, and that they should have more plutonium and uranium in the next few weeks, which would mean more nuclear missiles to try to launch to other countries. South Korea is also monitoring the site, and they see slow progress with the centers but no evidence of a nuclear launch yet. 

I do not know much about the North Korean nuclear program besides that they have threatened to launch at the US and other countries. However, I dont believe that there should ever be a nuclear war. There would be too many casualties and too much environmental damage.
