S"Iceland Prime Minister Temporarily Steps Down Because of Information from Panama Papers.\n\n(Icelands Prime Minister Steps Down Amid Panama Papers Scandal). - 4/5/16 (NY Times)\n\nBy: Varin Sikand\n\n\n\nThe Panama Papers are a group of about 11.5 million documents detailing some financial almost-scandals of high ranking government officials around the world. One such man is Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, the Prime Minister of Iceland. Basically, these almost scandals are acts that are maybe morally and ethically wrong, but not exactly illegal. For example, Davids wife here was proven to have a company (providing financial benefits for him) set up on the British Virgin Islands without properly disclosing this information. This location is important as it allows him & his wife to enjoy tax advantages. Because of this, he has stepped down, but no real consequences can happen as technically, these documents need to be investigated further before declaring it true. \n\nLong story short: The Prime Minister of Iceland (and his wife) are accused of using an offshore island (that gives illegal tax advantages) to host a company that allows him to basically dodge taxes, and therefore make money. However, since the documents that accuse him of this havent been technically proven, he has only stepped down from his position (without taking any actual punishment, like arrest or fines) because people in Iceland now don't like him.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nScandals have always been a staple of this world, and therefore, and staple of our stories and fables. A high ranking official that has secretly done things to better himself (at the cost of his people) is a lot like how Macbeth takes from others to better himself (both wrongly and secretly)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan takes advantage of Panama Papers to Skewer China\n\n(For Japan, Panama Papers are tool to skewer China) - 4/8/16 - USA Today\n\nVarin Sikand\n\n\n\nFor those who dont know, the Panama Papers are a group of about 11.5 million documents detailing some financial (tax-haven) almost-scandals of high ranking government officials around the world. Japan was (technically) one of the countries that was involved in this incident, however they managed to avoid the brunt of it. Yes there were plenty of people (in Japan) named in the papers, but, luckily for Japan, none were very important. No government people, or very significant citizens either, so Japan is more or less off the hook. However, their political rival, China, did not go unscathed. And Japan hopped on the bandwagon. See, since they didnt get affected by the tax avoidance accusations, they decided to suddenly make it a huge deal - Japan's Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported that the administration of Japanese President Shinzo Abe is considering raising the issue of offshore tax havens during the Group of 7 summit, or G-7, which Japan will host in May. Enhanced measures to combat tax avoidance by multinational companies were included in a joint statement at a G-7 meeting in Germany last year Probably hoping to point out their neighbor, China, they are using this opportunity to its fullest.\n\n\n\nOpinion and Connections to Shakespeare:\n\nI feel like Japan is doing well (as far as capitalizing on a potential scandal goes) and is simply using an opportune moment to snatch a sneaky victory. And, to me, there isnt anything wrong with that. If an opponent makes a major blunder (Like many Chinese officials did) then you should take advantage of that, and that is exactly what Japan did.\n\nThere really isnt a solid connection with any of the 3 plays (Macbeth, Twelfth Night, and King Lear) however, it can be said that this is much like King Lear, in that the 2 evil daughters took advantage of a certain mistake that the King made; so as to take his throne. The same way that Japan took advantage of Chinas blunder to gain an advantage socially, economically, and politically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina Striking Down on Panama Paper Accusations.\n\n(China Plans A Single, Chilling Response To The Panama Papers)\n\n4/10/16 - NY Times\n\nVarin Sikand\n\n\n\nAs in the other two papers I wrote, the Panama Papers are a bunch of documents talking about certain Tax-Haven scandals that officials worldwide have (assumingly) been a part of. China was also a part of this. In my summary of Japans involvement, I touched on China, but after more research, I give you Chinas side of this incident.\n\nChina was not immune to the effects of the Panama Papers. The brother in law of the Chinese President (Xi Jinping) was one of the people accused of taking advantage of some places that you can use to avoid taxes (called tax-havens). Now, China is being super protective and, while denying all claims of Xi doing anything wrong, is also full-on rejecting the Panama papers completely. As NY Times said, In China, Web postings are taken down, foreign publications blocked, Communist Party media blames the West, and leaders act as if nothing had happened,\n\n\n\nLong story short:\n\nChina, since their presidents brother was accused of illegally avoiding taxes, is now being really strict about the spread of this information, limiting all that can be said about this scandal.\n\n\n\nMy opinion\n\nChina seemed to have made a mistake, and is now desperately trying to cover it up. I havent read enough Shakespeare to properly relate this to something though."

S'Articles 1-3 (Current Events LCA)\n\nName: Nikhita Ramanujam\n\nTeam: Yellow 25\n\nRegion: Latin America\n\nTopic: Decision on the Impeachment of President Rousseff, Brazil\n\n\n\nArticle: Impeach Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Committee Says\n\nDate: 4/7/2016\n\nSource: CNN\n\n\n\nBrazils committee is in favor of impeaching its countrys current president, Dilma Rousseff. To impeach someone means to remove them from office, because they have done something politically wrong. This is because of her actions in office that have caused a lot of trouble to Brazilians and their country. Her actions include being the chairwoman of a state-run oil company, Petrobras, while a large, multi-million dollar kickback scheme took place. A kickback scheme is kind of like a bribe, except that the money is paid in certain amounts at certain times by a contractor, or in this case, somebody that uses a contract to provide the money for the bribe. Rousseff also tried to hide a problem in the national budget, a shortfall in cash, before the 2014 elections, so she could be elected for her second term, or a second set of years as president. Besides this, she appointed Brazils former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as her chief of staff shortly after he was questioned by police in an investigation about an oil company. By appointing him, it looked as if she were protecting Luiz from prosecution, or having legal action taken against him because he was charged as a criminal. After being questioned for all these wrongdoings, however, Rousseff denied her part in them. As she is president, Brazil itself faces a lot of problems, such as an extremely long economic downturn, the active Zika Virus (which deforms babies), and less interest in the Olympic Games, which it usually gains much from financially. To get Rousseff impeached, an action which many Brazilians call for in these hard times, there has to be a  agreement in the lower house of the legislative branch, the branch that makes laws, for the issue to reach the Senate, the upper house of the legislative branch. The decision must be reached within 180 days, in which time Rousseff is asked to step down from presidency and let her vice president reign, or she will continue to be the president until the end of her term. Though Rousseff states that she has not done anything wrong and should not be impeached, people overseeing this believe that she will not complete her second term, either through being impeached or ending her role as president with the new elections, to decide who will become the next president.\n\nI believe that President Rousseff will get impeached soon due to the evidence placed against her in taking part in many scandals. However, I believe that this might become a lengthy process, seeing as Rousseff denies many of the charges she is dealt with, unless the Brazilian government finds better proof to further their claims opposing their current president. This story might make for a Latin American form of Macbeth, where Rousseff plays Macbeth, who is power-hungry and corrupts many things in his conquest for this power. Brazil is facing many problems at this time, which might show as evidence of her unsuccessful presidency. I cannot relate this to the play my group has, which is King Lear.\n\n\n\nName: Nikhita Ramanujam\n\nTeam: Yellow 25\n\nRegion: Asia\n\nTopic: Dispute Between Hindus and Muslims on Political Freedom, Kashmir\n\n\n\nArticle: India Kashmir University Tense After Cricket Dispute\n\nDate: 4/6/2016\n\nSource: BBC\n\n\n\nSoon after India had lost to the West Indies after the World T20 Cricket semi-finals, there began to be arguments between students attending the National Institute of Technology in Kashmir and local police forces. Kashmir is an area with a majority of their population as Muslims, followers of the Islamic religion, which India governs and is in charge of, despite the fact that most of India follows the religion of Hinduism rather than Islam. As soon as India had lost the match, many Kashmiri students from inside the school began to cheer, preventing others from raising the national flag of India. Classes were suspended after clashes, which were sometimes violent, broke out on campus between the Kashmiris and the Non-Kashmiris. Police had to become involved in the situation due to all the fighting. These arguments are the result of a deep-seated dispute, or argument, between Kashmir and India where Kashmir wants to either separate from the country or join Pakistan. Kashmir and Pakistan both have a large population of Muslims while Indias majority consists of the followers of Hinduism. The area of Kashmir has been historically known as the birthplace of  of the Indian-Pakistani Wars, or wars between the countries of India and Pakistan during the years of 1947-1948 and 1965. On Tuesday night, on April 5th, Non-Kashmiri students attempted to leave the campus. Though police attempted to stop them, the students attacked the policemen with stones, before being fought back at by the guards with force. Some students got injured, and the group further complains that the police confiscated the national flag of India that they were carrying, or took it away. Classes resumed the next day, but students still boycotted due to the earlier protests, the Non-Kashmiri students wanting the Indian flag to be hoisted in front of the school next to the Kashmir state flag. The Education Minister, or principal of education on campus, Smriti Irani, has sent word to government officials, including the chief minister of state, to solve the issue and ensure a safe environment for students at school. The entire event brings back what happened two months ago at Jawaharlal Nehru University; a student was arrested for chanting anti-national slogans. This arrest caused a debate, or argument, on nationalism, which can be wanting political independence for a certain country. The student was released from jail in March, but the issue of independence, or freedom, continues between both India and Kashmir.\n\nIn my opinion, violence between both Kashmir and India will continue because of the hatred situated between both Muslims and Hindus. Kashmir might separate from India in the long-run, but if it joins with Pakistan, fighting might occur additionally because of the fact that there is still a handful of Hindus in Kashmir which oppose Pakistani Muslims. The rift between the lesser-represented state of Kashmir and the larger power of India can be related to Shakespeares Julius Caesar. The people of Rome think that Julius Caesar is becoming too powerful, and want to separate from him, just like Kashmir wants to separate from India, the higher governing power. I cannot, however, relate this article to any of the Shakespeare plays that we are working on.\n\n\n\nName: Nikhita Ramanujam\n\nTeam: Yellow 25\n\nRegion: Europe\n\nTopic: (Evidence of) The Attacks on Brussels, Belgium\n\n\n\nArticle: Surveillance Footage, Cab Driver Offer Clues in Investigation in Brussels Attack\n\nDate: 3/23/2016\n\nSource: CNN\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, March 22nd, there were explosions set off in an airport in Brussels, Belgium and at the Maelbeek metro station. The blasts caused around 30 deaths and 230 injuries. ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, is a terrorist group which says that they set off the explosions, though police were not sure at the time if they were the culprits due to lack of evidence. Now, they have used camera film and statements from witnesses during the time of the attack to find whomever is responsible. A recording of the airport taken from a camera show three men with their luggage, two of which are dressed in black and who died when they set off the bombs. The other, who is now the primary suspect in the matter, was dressed in a light suit with a dark hat, and had apparently left the airport. Police asked everybody to actively look for this man. News came soon after; the taxi driver who had dropped the men off at the airport sent word to the police. The taxi driver gave them the address of the suspects and the police conducted a search at the place. In the house they searched, in a north-eastern Brussels neighborhood named Schaerbeek, they found a nail bomb, chemicals, and an ISIS flag. Police stayed in the building for hours, finding evidence and taking pictures, while guards stood outside and secured the premises. The police were carrying bags of evidence with them as they left the building. The police started to connect the dots between these recent attacks, which left people to flee out onto the streets and areas to be evacuated, to the attacks on Paris. Salah Abdeslam, the major suspect of the attacks on Paris in November, was arrested merely days before the attacks in Belgium; this makes police believe that Abdeslams group and the people who set off the bombs in Brussels are related. ISIS also says that it was behind both the Belgium and Paris attacks. Belgian Prime Minister, Charles Michel, says that there is no information on whether both attacks are connected so far, but that it is being investigated, or looked into. Belgium officials, or people in its government, recounted that they knew danger could be lurking at any moment, with many people on Belgium joining ISIS and returning home; the bombs set of were proof of this. Though the terrorist attacks left people feeling surprised and in danger, Michel says that Belgium, the home of international organizations like NATO and the EU, will stay strong in the fight against threats like terrorists. ISIS supporters wrote back on Twitter saying that there may be worse things coming in the future.\n\nWhat scared me most is what is being foreshadowed by ISIS supporters. They state that what has happened, leaving many dead and injured with much property destroyed, is not the worst to come. In the meantime, though, many are taking actions against the terrorist organization in attempt to release its malicious presence on places like Iraq and Syria. According to the Prime Minister of Belgium, even, the attacks cannot make the country weaker. I am hopeful that ISIS will no longer pose such a great threat as they state they are in the coming years, as more precautions are taken to prevent them from launching terrorist attacks. However, they are still capable enough and have a large-enough network to continue attacks similar to what has been seen in recent months. This can be perfectly related to Macbeth, where someone/ something, or in this case, ISIS, is so power-hungry that they began to attack others to get into power. There might be some people in ISIS that even deteriorate mentally from all the terror that they see because of the actions that they commit. I cannot, however, relate this to the play chosen by my group, King Lear.'

S'Brazils committee is in favor of impeaching its countrys current president, Dilma Rousseff'
p123
aS'To impeach someone means to remove them from office, because they have done something politically wrong'
p124
aS'This is because of her actions in office that have caused a lot of trouble to Brazilians and their country'
p125
aS'Her actions include being the chairwoman of a state-run oil company, Petrobras, while a large, multi-million dollar kickback scheme took place'
p126
aS'A kickback scheme is kind of like a bribe, except that the money is paid in certain amounts at certain times by a contractor, or in this case, somebody that uses a contract to provide the money for the bribe'
p127
aS'Rousseff also tried to hide a problem in the national budget, a shortfall in cash, before the 2014 elections, so she could be elected for her second term, or a second set of years as president'
p128
aS'Besides this, she appointed Brazils former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as her chief of staff shortly after he was questioned by police in an investigation about an oil company'
p129
aS'By appointing him, it looked as if she were protecting Luiz from prosecution, or having legal action taken against him because he was charged as a criminal'
p130
aS'After being questioned for all these wrongdoings, however, Rousseff denied her part in them'
p131
aS'As she is president, Brazil itself faces a lot of problems, such as an extremely long economic downturn, the active Zika Virus (which deforms babies), and less interest in the Olympic Games, which it usually gains much from financially'
p132
aS'To get Rousseff impeached, an action which many Brazilians call for in these hard times, there has to be a  agreement in the lower house of the legislative branch, the branch that makes laws, for the issue to reach the Senate, the upper house of the legislative branch'
p133
aS'The decision must be reached within 180 days, in which time Rousseff is asked to step down from presidency and let her vice president reign, or she will continue to be the president until the end of her term'
p134
aS'Though Rousseff states that she has not done anything wrong and should not be impeached, people overseeing this believe that she will not complete her second term, either through being impeached or ending her role as president with the new elections, to decide who will become the next president.'
p135
aS'I believe that President Rousseff will get impeached soon due to the evidence placed against her in taking part in many scandals'
p136
aS'However, I believe that this might become a lengthy process, seeing as Rousseff denies many of the charges she is dealt with, unless the Brazilian government finds better proof to further their claims opposing their current president'
p137
aS'This story might make for a Latin American form of Macbeth, where Rousseff plays Macbeth, who is power-hungry and corrupts many things in his conquest for this power'
p138
aS'Brazil is facing many problems at this time, which might show as evidence of her unsuccessful presidency'

aS'Soon after India had lost to the West Indies after the World T20 Cricket semi-finals, there began to be arguments between students attending the National Institute of Technology in Kashmir and local police forces'
p140
aS'Kashmir is an area with a majority of their population as Muslims, followers of the Islamic religion, which India governs and is in charge of, despite the fact that most of India follows the religion of Hinduism rather than Islam'
p141
aS'As soon as India had lost the match, many Kashmiri students from inside the school began to cheer, preventing others from raising the national flag of India'
p142
aS'Classes were suspended after clashes, which were sometimes violent, broke out on campus between the Kashmiris and the Non-Kashmiris'
p143
aS'Police had to become involved in the situation due to all the fighting'
p144
aS'These arguments are the result of a deep-seated dispute, or argument, between Kashmir and India where Kashmir wants to either separate from the country or join Pakistan'
p145
aS'Kashmir and Pakistan both have a large population of Muslims while Indias majority consists of the followers of Hinduism'
p146
aS'The area of Kashmir has been historically known as the birthplace of  of the Indian-Pakistani Wars, or wars between the countries of India and Pakistan during the years of 1947-1948 and 1965'
p147
aS'On Tuesday night, on April 5th, Non-Kashmiri students attempted to leave the campus'
p148
aS'Though police attempted to stop them, the students attacked the policemen with stones, before being fought back at by the guards with force'
p149
aS'Some students got injured, and the group further complains that the police confiscated the national flag of India that they were carrying, or took it away'
p150
aS'Classes resumed the next day, but students still boycotted due to the earlier protests, the Non-Kashmiri students wanting the Indian flag to be hoisted in front of the school next to the Kashmir state flag'
p151
aS'The Education Minister, or principal of education on campus, Smriti Irani, has sent word to government officials, including the chief minister of state, to solve the issue and ensure a safe environment for students at school'
p152
aS'The entire event brings back what happened two months ago at Jawaharlal Nehru University; a student was arrested for chanting anti-national slogans'
p153
aS'This arrest caused a debate, or argument, on nationalism, which can be wanting political independence for a certain country'
p154
aS'The student was released from jail in March, but the issue of independence, or freedom, continues between both India and Kashmir.'

They have been given the right to vote, right of citizenship and now the right to fight alongside the men on the front lines. On April 4th, 2016 Tammy Barrett was the first woman to sign up for the front line. Women in the infantry have been discussed for many years, but progress is being made. On April 4th, the processing center got word that women would be allowed to sign up for combat jobs on the front lines. This has sparked many women to begin signing up for the front line. \n\n\n\nIn my opinion, you should have the right to fight for your country in any squad/position no matter what gender you are. The case against this was, women being too weak and not strong enough to fight the enemy. This can be true, but women arent weak, even if they are weak you can still train them to be stronger. This reminds me of the play Julius Caesar (Caesar was celebrated after the return from winning his war) ,Tammy being the Julius Caesar who everyone celebrates for being the first women to sign up for the front line. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nArticle 2: Texas teacher arrested after video shows her hitting student\n\nDate: 4/10/16\n\nSource: Fox News\n\n\n\nOn April 8th, a teacher was charged with misdemeanor assault for hitting a child multiple times. There was a twelve second video showing the teacher hitting the kid that went viral in the matter of hours. She was then arrested after video surfaced appearing to show her hitting a student multiple times during a Friday morning high school math class. You know we only see 12 seconds of [the video], the student said. Thats all it is. Its not the whole thing. - One student told the reporter.\n\n\n\nI think that this teacher shouldnt be arrested because the kids in the class told the news that the teacher was insulted and cussed at. She was described as a veteran teacher working as a teacher for more than 15 years. He lost her patience once and now is being arrested, but these kids throw stuff at her and cuss at her 24/7. This reminds me of Julius Caesar, the kid being Brutus and the teacher being Caesar. In the story Brutus and others kill Caesar to prevent him from becoming king. This is an example how the kid tries to torment the teacher and prevent her from teaching.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nArticle 3: Canadian Attawapiskat First Nation suicide emergency\n\nDate: 4/10/6\n\nSource: BBC\n\n\n\nIn North Canada, there was a community in which 11 people in the same day tried to kill themselves. Bruce Shisheesh, the chief of the Attawapiskat First Nation community, said 11 people attempted to take their own lives on Saturday, prompting him to declare a state of emergency. - said by BBC News. As said in the article Canada's 1.4 million indigenous people have high levels of poverty. Their life expectancy is also below the Canadian average. In Canada there have been more than 30 suicides in the month of March alone. So the prime minister of canada wrote a speech on these suicidal acts described as heartbreaking. This has concluded as a first nation suicidal emergency. \n\n\n\nI think that actions could of been taking to different matters. Suicide is never the answer. I think that if you are suicidal you should always talk to someone and get help. Today suicide affects not only the victims, but the families which cared so much about the victims. This relates to Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet because the victims are sad and suicidal like the two main characters in the play; Romeo and Juliet."
